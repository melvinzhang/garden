speaker: Dave Farley

Evolution of production
* craft
  * generally of poor quality
* mass production
  * standardised components and steps
* lean production techniques
  * pull based
  * minimise waste

We got the model wrong
* eg heliocentrism vs geocentrism

All engineering is not the same
* different forms of engineering
* at different scales

Iterative development
* The Shard was built iteratively

Fundamentals of an "engineering" approach
* iterative
  * learn, react, adapt
* employs feedback
* incremental
  * modular system
  * eg Apollo lunar landing
  * small batch size
* experimental
  * The Ranger Programme
* empirical
