Computational Thinking is Pervasive, Alan Bundy

Can students see that?

1D is the mini projects
2D is a common project across subjects

Digital world and physical chemistry
* plotting the orbit of electron in hydrogen atom
* mathematics of the orbital from chemistry

Digital world and physical world
* predicting final temperature
* how digital thermometer works

Digital world with biology
* cost of designing a DNA primer
* using simulated annealing
* how to find the best primer

2D design challenge
* using SAT solver to optimize the ALU
