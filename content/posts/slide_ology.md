** Creating a new slide ideology
 * 7 qns to know your audience
 ** what are they like?
 ** why are they here?
 ** what keeps them up at night?
 ** how can you solve their problem?
 ** what do you want them to do?
 ** how might they resist?
 ** how can you best reach them?
 * create an audience persona slide

** Creating ideas, not slides
 * avoid the pitfall of going with the first thing that comes to mind
 * sticky notes allows ides to be captured, sorted, and re-arranged as needed
 * sketching
 * drawing stick figures: body, head, facial expression, legs, arms

** Displaying data
 * data slides are NOT about the data
 * they are about the MEANING of the data
 * tell the truth
 * get to the point
 * pick the right tool
 * highlight what is important
 * keep it simple
 * articulate the conclusions you want your audience to adopt
 * make it easy for them to draw conclusions
 * use the right tool (pie charts, bar charts, line graphs)
 * just the conclusion + image OR showing all the data + highlights
 * background, data, emphasis
 * keep it simple (3 second rule)

** Arranging elements
 * placement of elements creates meaning
 * contrast, flow, hierarchy, unity, proximity, whitespace
 * contrast: identifying the main point quickly
 * "use just notable differences, visual elemtns that make a clear difference but no more..." - Tufte
 * flow: ordering how information is processed
 * images of people should look at the content instead of looking away
 * hierarchy: seeubg relationship between elements
 * unity: sensing the structure of information, grid system
 * proximity: preceving meaning from location
 * whitespace: visual breathing room
 * finding beauty in design around you

** Using visual elements: bg, color, and text
 * power in breaking the consistency
 * think through what is really required in the bg
 * consistency in: 2D or 3D, vanishing point, light source
 * color: industry specific, audience
 * using the Isaac Newton's color wheel
 * dark vs light background, take note of contrast
 * assembling a color palette: 3-5 core colors, a neutral and a highlight color
 * 3 second rule for slides
 * proper typesetting
 * no smaller than 28pt

** Using visual elements: images
 * have a library of images with re-usable parts
 * images of people should: reflect culture/ethnicity, represent real life situations, account for current era
 * rule of thirds
 * look cohesive

** Creating movement
 * movements attract attention, use it carefully to avoid distracting the audience
 * should look natural and alive, seem familiar and make sense
 * hide slide elements until you need to refer to them
 * natural motions: left to right, top to bottom
 * content can pan from scene to scene using push left transition
 * avoid visual vertigo

** Governing with Templates
 * arm employees with templates to ensure consistency
 * logo, color palette, grid layout, fonts, graphical elements
 * types of slides: walk-in slides, title slide, quote slide, transition slide, Q&A

** Interacting with slides
 * avoid using slides as teleprompters: reduce, record, repeat
 * end on time and leave time for questions
 * Case study: Pecha Kucha - 20 slides, each 20s
 * visual pauses using blank slides
 * top concern is how well you communicate, not how good you look (slide envy)
 * 10/20/30 rule by Guy Kawasaki (10 slides, 20 minutes, font size at least 30pts)
 * communication aids: flip chart, handout, mobile device, video, social network, web cast, projector, prop
 * Case study: Jill Bolte-Taylor's TED talk, few slides, hugh gestures, and a memorable prop

** Five theses of the Power of a Presentation
 * Treat your audience as king
 * Spread ideas and move people
 * Help them see what you're saying
 * Practice design, not decoration
 * Cultivate healthy relationships between you, slides, and audience
