** Human genome variation
 *SNPs, structural variants eg. copy number variants, indel, inversions
 *>12% of the genome prone to SVs (Redon et al., Nature 2006)
 *resolution of SVs usually ~50kb, breakpoints are unknown
** Fine-mapping of SVs using high resolution tiling MA
 *Break-Pointer algorithm for SV breakpoint detection, based on HMM (Korbel et al., PNAS 2007)
 *Novel tech (HR-CGH) and scoring approach (Break-Pointer) for fine mapping of SVs
 *Abundance of SVs < 50kbs
** Genome-wide mapping of SVs in two human genomes using 454 sequencing
high-resolution and massive paired-end mapping (PEM), Korbel et. al., Science 2007
#mapping of paired ends against reference genome
#comparison of paired-end span against expected distribution
#categorization of outliers into groups
*** Results
 *17% of SVs in both genomes affect genes
 *13% of affected genes (355) have altered gene structures
 *validation against HR-CGH, Fiber-FISH, PCR spanning PEM-predicted breakpoints
 *14% of SVs formed through non-allelic homologous recombination
 *30% of SVs formed through retrotransposition
 *56% of SVs formed through non-homologous end-joining
 *examples of SVs: gene fusion of 2 olfactory receptor genes on chr11
** Future work
 *scaling up to multiple human genomes, www.1000genomes.org
