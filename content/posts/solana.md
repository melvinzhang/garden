* "roughly 5% of blocks donâ€™t end up being finalized by the cluster"
  * ref: https://docs.solana.com/developing/transaction_confirmation
* processed -> confirmed -> finalized
* confirmed is few slots behind processed, low chance of belonging to a dropped fork
* finalized is about 32 slot behind confirmed block
