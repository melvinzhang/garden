These little (big) guys are the oldest living relative of modern day cats. The
[Pallas’s Cat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pallas%27s_Cat) is the oldest
living species of a clade of felids that includes the modern genus **Felis**.
This feline, along with the extinct Martelli’s Cat, was probably one of the
first two modern cats to evolve from **Pseudaelurus** approximately 12 million
years ago.
