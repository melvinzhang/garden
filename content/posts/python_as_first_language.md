The choice of the first programming language to introduce computer science
concepts has always been a hotly debated topic. In SoC, we offer a choice of
either Scheme (CS1101S) or Java (CS1101), the second programming course which
focuses on data structures and algorithms is taught in Java only. Recently I've
read a couple of articles (Zelle 1999, Chou 2002) which prompted me to look at
this issue again.

 * CS2103 is in Java, early exposure helps students to cope with idiosyncrasies of the languag
 * CS3215 is in C++ or C#
