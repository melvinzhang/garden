{"title": "Field guide to the algorithmic interview", "tags": ["talk"]}
speaker: Wong Yiwen
event: Hackers and Painters
** interview process
 * prescreening coding test
 * 2-3 phone interviews
 * 3-5 on-site interviews
 * each interview ~1hr long, between 1-8 qns each
 * high false positive rate
 * international candidates can try once a year
** phone interview
 * phone call or skype/google hangout
 * live coding, using Google docs or CollabEdit
 * scheduling protip: Daylight savings time
** on-site interview
 * code on the whiteboard
 * lousy markers? bring your own markers
** types of questions asked
 * programming languages
 * general cs
   what is idempotence?
 * coding/algorithmic
 * design
   how would you create google maps?
 * behavioural
   why would you want to work with us?
 * NO lateral thinking/puzzle questions
 * NO fermi questions
recruiter usually sends an information packet telling you the topics.
** coding/algorithmic questions
 * given two strings, return true if they are anagrams
 * write a program that prints out the powerset of N elements
 * NO implement quicksort
 * NO how to balance an avl tree
 * NO compute the transitive closure of data dependencies of a given C-type program
 * BAD standard problems covered in some CS curriculums
   ends up as a test of where you went to school
 * is your solution optimal? how to optimize?
   discuss the space and run time complexity
 * how to test your solution?
 * data does not fit into RAM?
** field tips
 * know your data structures: lists/arrays/hashmaps/trees/heap/graphs
 * know some basic algorithmic approaches
 * studying specific "complicated" algorithms are a waste of time, eg A*, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford
 * more important to know data structures than algorithms
 * know the implementation language and complexity of data structures/algorithms in standard library
 * pick something interviewer friendly with predictale runtime, eg Java
   some scripting languages may have strange runtime performance
 * know the machine/environment, eg cache vs RA
 * make the examples easy to build on, list of 100, 200, 800 instead of list of 1, 2, 8
 * discuss characterisics of the problem/solution
 * observations about approaches that don't work
** preparation
 * how to approach white boarding problems
