Auralization is about recreating the sense of physical space through
auditory sensory input and acoustics modelling
** How it works?
room characteristics, sound events, arrange in time and space |
calculation of sound transmission > room impluse response

room impulse response + neutral audio > resulting audio
** Issue with current practice - passive listening
** Interactive auralization
*** motion
*** real time sound sources
*** incorporating visual information
*** change environmental characteristics
** Adding real time sound sources
*** enable communication
*** use own voice
*** implemented in Pure Data
** work of acousticians
*** usually works with the architect
*** acoustics design comparable to lighting
*** to enchance the experience of the listener
