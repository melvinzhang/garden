{"title": "META II: A compiler-compiler that generates its own code", "tags": ["contrib"]}

Most of the time we treat compilers as black boxes but what really goes on
under the hood? In this demo, I will demonstrate a DSL for writing compilers
and a compiler-compiler that turns the DSL into a compiler. Amazingly, we can
describe the compiler-compiler itself in only 26 lines of the DSL.
