UI vs UX

the interface
* what is looks like, how it works
* the mechanics
the experience
* what does the user feel has he/she uses the product
* the emotional response

Stroke my ego: the UX of a slot machine, checking email, hits to your blog

Seems magicial: Pandora, Shazam

Gives people super powers: TaskRabbit

Feels effortless: Dropbox, RescueTime

Accrues value: Evernote
