Use of FTIR for diagnosis of prostate cancer

uses spectral region 750 - 4000cm^-1 with 1847 -- 2809cm^-1 removed as it
contains no diagnostically useful information.

The spectra were vector normalised, each value is divided by the square root
of sum of squares [[Lasch2004]].

Principal Component Discriminant Function Analysis was used to discriminate
the spectra, major spectral peaks responsible for each discriminant function
was analyzed and annotated.
