Key ideas:
convert analog problem of spectrum into digital problem

idea of pruning full length candidate proteins to make it more compact, accurate

empty - tags - gapped proteins - full length proteins

A spectral profile is like a PSSM matrix that summarize a number of top scoring
proteins.

A protein can be represented as a binary string, which is a bitset represent
possible prefix masses.

Can compute spectral profile using DP without computing all high scoring
peptides.
