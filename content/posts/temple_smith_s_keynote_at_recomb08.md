Simple methods for tackling hard problems. Complex systems are produced by a simple process of evolution.

Phylogeny and recovering ancestral gene order from Nearest Pair (paper in Genome Biology)
* look at breakpoints across different gene orders

Linear algebra for balancing flux in metabolic networks, without complex differential equations/kinetics.

Identical systems are not identical, need to consider ensembles of cells to get a full picture of the underlying biologoy.

Biology is noisy but robust, relies on stochastic processes.
