 * 2 mechanisms of gene duplication
 ** single gene (generation -> fixation -> preservation)
 ** whole genome duplication (WGD -> rearrangements/gain/loss -> preservation)
 * Functional difference between WGD and small scale duplications
 ** relation between duplicate similarity and essentiality?
 ** relation between duplicate sequence divergence and expression divergence?
 * Quantification of functional divergence using Bayesian network to integrate (bioPIXIE), train using GO data
 * Functional enrichment of SSD and WDG are different
 * Use shared functional relationship as similarity in function, WGD > SSD for sequence identity vs %functional/physical interaction partners
 * WGD much more functional similar as compared to SSD
 * SSD more similar in expression
