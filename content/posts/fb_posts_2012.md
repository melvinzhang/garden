Dec 01: Magarena 1.32 released. I'm considering this as the November release since it is still November somewhere in the world. The most exciting development in this release is the rules text parser based on Parsing Expression Grammar @ https://code.google.com/p/magarena/source/browse/grammar/mtg.peg The current grammar is able to parse 49.7% of all rules text.

Nov 25: Decided to take the plunge and upgrade to MetaARPA membership on sdf.org. The service is amazing, my account is updated almost immediately, even though the description to the sysad is just a description on the paypal donation which was manually filled in. For folks who miss ol' sunfire, consider getting a lifetime account on sdf.org ($36USD one time payment). If you need more compute power and storage, the MetaARPA membership ($36USD annual) provides access to a Linux compute cluster, similar to tembusu.

Aug 20: Had my first sanctioned tournament game at CMG:BW today, format was Standard Pauper. Wasn't expecting to play but last minute decided to join for the heck of it. Didn't win any games, but learned a lot and had fun in the games. I still prefer digital cards to real ones, but I kept the Moonsilver Spear promo as a memento of the event.

There is a healthy part which is attempting to normalize and to create predictability, and there needs to be another part that is tasked with building something new that is going to disrupt and eventually destroy that normality."
