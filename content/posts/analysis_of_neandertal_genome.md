If Neandertals are on average most closely related to present-dat human in
certain parts of the world then in others, this would strongly suggest that
Neandertails exchanged parts of their genome with the ancestors of this group.

Challenges in sequencing of ancient DNA:
 * DNA is degraded to a small average size of less than 200bp
 * it is chemically modified
 * extracts almost always contain only small amounts of DNA from microbial
* organisms that colonized the specimens after death

It is necessary to identify the DNA molecules that are from neandertal by
comparing against the human and chimp genome.

Analyze Neandertal segmental duplications by measuring excess read-depth to
identify and predict the copy number of duplicated sequences, defined as those
with >95% sequence identity.

Neandertals are on average closer to individuals in Eurasia than to
individuals in Africa. They may be explained by mixing of early humans
ancestral to present-day non-Africans with Neandertails in the Middle East
before their expansion into Eurasia.

Another scenario is that the ancestral population of present-day non-Africans
was more closely related to Neandertals than the ancestral population of
present-day Africans due to ancient substructure within Africa.

Neandertals are likely to have had a role in the genetic ancestry of
present-day humans outside of Africa, however this role was relatively minor
given that only a few percent of the genomes of present-day people outside
Africa are derived from Neandertals.

A number of regions genomic regions, such as those involved in cognitive
abilities and cranial morphology, are candidates for positive selection early
in modern human history.
