** Metabolics
# lipidomics
## head group
## tails
# sugars
# toxins

** Uses
# energy store (metabolism)
# cellular membranes
# foreign lipids - diseases caused by bacteria
# signaling

** Interactions
# lipid receptors
# interfacial bindings
# integral interactions
# with proteins

** Equipment
# ESI-MS
# Tandem MS
# Precursor Ion Scan (class specific fragmentation)
# Thin layer chromatography

** Examples
# growing vs dormant bacteria
# difference in lipids
# look at lipid profile of different states, overlay difference profile
# identification of ions in difference profile
# identification of biochemical pathway

** Analysis of lipid profile
# Correlation Optimized Warping algorithm
## alignment of profile to eliminate warping
# Identification of the peaks
# Similarity of lipids (molecular mimicry)

** Application of lipidomics
# identification of biochemical pathways
# novel lipids
# as a test for diseases
## eg. TB by testing for lipids not found in human
# blood lipids as biomarkers
