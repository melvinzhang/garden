{"title": "How Alan Turing accidentally invented Software", "tags": ["contrib"]}

Abstract: We use software regularly without thinking too much of it, but do you wonder
how it all came to be? Turing was the first person to realize that by using
different software a single machine can be made to perform any task. In this
talk, we will demonstrate his insight through a series of demos.

This was inspired by my reading of Turing's 1936 paper, initially for a Papers
We Love session. I gave this talk at GeekCampSG 2019. I remember speaking to
other attendees after the talk about the different types of typewriters. One of
the rare talks where there was some follow-up discussion.
