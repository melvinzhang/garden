 * brain does not record information like a videocassette recorder, instead it handles information by reducing it into meaningful chunks that we call categories
 * examples are a primary means of making connection between old and new knowledge
 * once a new concept has been introduced, students need an opportunity to practice thinking in terms of that concept
 * adult learners can been in tuned for no more than 15 to 20 minutes
 * recommend building a "change-up" into your class to restart the attention clock
 * activities should be integrally related to giving students practice with the most important concepts in the day's class
 * particularly effective are collaborative learning techniques, as they reduce student passivity
 * use 20 minutes attention span as a rule of thumb
 * variety is a powerful force
 * earmark at least 1/3 of the time for debriefing
