on 09/01/09.<p>I attended a
[talk](https://mysoc.nus.edu.sg/%C2%A0cmsem/seminar_files/9655.txt) by [Randall Bryant](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/%C2%A0bryant/) on Data Intensive Scalable
Computing. His focus was on computer systems for processing large amounts of
data.

I realized the importance of data driven computations earlier though my
experience setting programming assignments. I think it is important to have
problems that are realistic; where you want to write the programs in order to
see the results. Unfortunately, most of the time we are technique driven. We
try to form a task around a specific method. However, most problems usually
have a rather trivial solution, therefore we need to impose some unreasonable
constraints or increase the size of the problem to some unbelievably large size
in order to force the use of specific techniques.

I think the correct approach is to start from the data. There are large amount
of interesting data that is available over the web, from
[movies](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces) to
[tags](http://www.tagora-project.eu/data/). In the UNIX workshop I conducted
for freshmen orientation 2008, I made use of the [SMS corpus](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%C2%A0rpnlpir/downloads/corpora/smsCorpus/)
from the [WING](http://wing.comp.nus.edu.sg/portal/) research group to
motivate the use of UNIX pipes.

Dealing with large amounts of publicly available real world data gives rise to
realistic computational problems where the effect of efficient algorithms
become apparent. Computations that takes hours to run using a naive method can
be completed in seconds using the correct approach. </p>
