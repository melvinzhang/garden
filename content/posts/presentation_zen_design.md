# Presenting with type
Make it BIG.

Make sure text on images is clear

# Communication with color

Desaturate background images.  Add emphasis with color.

Full-bleed images offer ultimate impact

Improve images through cropping

Change the pace with video.

Embed the video in your slides, it should be seamless.

Have a background video playing while the text displays.

Framing embedded video.

# Simplifying the data
Signal vs noise

Restrain, reduce, emphasize

Tell a story with the data, if possible animate


# Seeing and using space
White space can direct the viewer's eyes.

Space allows elements to breathe.   It is this invisible breath that sustains
and empowers.

White space in an asymetrically balanced visual is activated.

Horizontal visual center is slightly above the true center.

Direct the eyes.

Use closure to engage viewers.

The power of implied space/depth.


# Creating purpose and focus
Tell stories.

Contrast: size, shape, orientation, position, tone, color.

Large foreground elements create depth.

Have a clear focal point.

Low background salience.

Preference for faces.

Add motion/transition to build a slide or show change.

# Achieving harmony
Simplify to unify.

Provide visual cues/sign posts.

Connect the elements (alignment).

Use a grid. The rule of thirds.
