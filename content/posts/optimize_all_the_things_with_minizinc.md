What do Sudoku and finding a shortest route to deliver a set of packages have
in common? Both are hard problems which require us to find the best solution
satisfying multiple constraints. Instead of writing a custom program for each
problem, we can describe the problem in MiniZinc and then use a generic solver
to find the solution. This session will demo how we can model a variety of
problems in MiniZinc, a free and open-source constraint modelling language.
