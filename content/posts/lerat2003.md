TITLE: Multigene phylogeny using complete genomes of gamma-Proteobacteria
gamma-Proteobacteria: model of bacteria diversification, includes free-living
and communal species, intracellular symbionts, and plant and animal pathogens

LGT is known to be extensive in this group, most often involves uptake of
genes assuming functions that are not represented in the recipient and
arriving from distantly related bacteria or phage.

Replacement of single-copy orthologous genes is rare, most single-copy
orthologous genes show broad phylogenetic agreement that reflects the
organismal relationships

Construction of gene families: consider ratio of BLASTP score to maximal BLASTP
score (self comparison). Distribution is bimodal, separation occurs at about
30%. Protein was included in a family if this criterion was satisfied for at
least one member
