Title: Fifty years of protein structure: the ever-chaning paradigm of sequence structure relationship

Hardness of protein folding

Biological requirements
 * function
 * fast folding

Proteins not selected for stability. A marginal stability can assist folding.
Folding is cooperative. Defects can be resolved by local interactions.

Structural classification of proteins (SCOP)

Metamorphic proteins not as rare as once believed, so the assumption that one
sequence leads to one structure not always true.
