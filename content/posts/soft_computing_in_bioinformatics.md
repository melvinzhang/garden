 * Granular computing
 * Genetic algorithms
 ** multiple objective GA
 ** Pareto optimal solutions
 ** VEGA, MOGA, NSGA
 * Rough sets
 ** lower and upper approximations
 ** discover redundancies and dependencies between features
 ** discernability matrix -> reducts
 * Rough clustering
 ** fuzzy clustering
 ** rough c-means
 * Rough feature selections
 * Focus on clustering, classification, rule mining
 ** low cost, high precision solution
 * Protein structure
 ** secondary
 ** tertiary
 ** docking
 * Micro array gene expression
## selecting a set of relevant genes
## identify causal and classification relationships
## gene clustering (similar changes)
## data (samples) clustering
## gene regulatory network discovery
