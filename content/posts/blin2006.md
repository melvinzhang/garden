Greedy approach for determining gene matching

First determine set of anchors, then recursively match common intervals using
a heuristic for Minimum Inextensible Box Covering.

Does not try to compute the pair of permutations that is optimal for a given
combinatorial criterion but rely on the greedy approach of recursively
matching genomic segments having a common combinatorial structure

Extension of a previous gene matching algorithm that iteratively matchings
LCS, common interval is better than LCS
