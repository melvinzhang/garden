The truth about relativity
* we are wired to compare things
* similar things are easier to compare
* the decoy effect (Paris without coffee, Paris, London)

The fallacy of supply and demand
* demand can be created (story of Tahitian black pearls)
* anchoring effect, arbitrary coherence
* self-herding (switching from Dunkin' Donuts to Starbucks)
* question your habits!
* pay attention to the first decision

The cost of zero cost
* presence of free may lead us to make a bad choice
* when something is free, we forget the downside (loss aversion)
* zero price effect
* pain of paying (one person should pay the entire bill)

The cost of social norms
* voluntary, gifts keeps us in social norms, money gets us to market norms
* even thinking about money shifts us towards market norms
* open source is primarily in the realm of social norms
* improving the education system by igniting a social passion
* Burning Man and its rejection of market norms (money not allowed)
* gifts are financially inefficient, but they are an important social lubricant

The power of a free cookie
* when price is reduced to zero, people sacrifice their own desired for the benefit of others (social norm)
* same thing happens in a communal plate of food (the last piece is left)
* effort manages to keep a large part of the social norms
* the dark side of putting a price on pollution

The influence of arousal
* magnitude of underprediction of how arousal affects our decision making was substantial
* prediction what we will do in a different emotional state is extremely difficult

The problem of procrastination and self-control
* equally spaced externally enforced deadlines is the best cure for procrastination
* without precommitments, we keep on falling for temptation
* commit up front to a fix schedule
* schedules of reinforcement (magic of gambling and playing the lottery, occasional nice email/new article)
* create positive associations to encourage good behaviors
* our top killer is our inability to make smart choices and overcome our own self-destructive behaviors

The high price of ownership
* ownership changes our perspective
* we fall in love with what we have
* we focus on what we may lose rather than what we may gain
* we assume other people will see the transaction from our perspective
* "virtual ownership" in the case of online auctions/trial promotions
* view all transactions as if you were a nonowner
* "The Lake Wobegone Effect"

Keeping doors open
* people are beset not by a lack of opportunity, but by a dizzying abundance of it
* irrational impulse to chase worthless options
* consciously start closing some of our doors
* take into account the consequence of not deciding (story of starving donkey and similar stacks of hay)

The effect of expectations
* expectations can alter our experience
* Coke vs Pepsi experiment
* stereotypes can affect our behavior
* Joshua Bell's performance at the Metro
* positive expectation allow us to enjoy things more and improve our perception of the world

The power of price
* pricey medicine do make us feel better
* placebos run on the power of suggestion
* SoBe drink (message + price was more powerful than the beverage)
* consumers who stop to reflect the relationship between price and quality are less likely to assume a discounted drink is less effective

The cycle of distrust
* evidence of deep mistrust in people
* tragedy of the commons
* erosion of trust over time (dating site, resumes)
* origin of a statement affects our trust
* boy who cried wolf

Why we are dishonest
* two types of dishonesty (out right criminals vs white collar crime)
* our internal honesty monitor is active only when we contemplate big transgressions
* all participants cheat a little, independent of the risk of being caught
* thinking about an honor code stops cheating!

Dealing with cash makes us honest
* the further away from cold hard cash, the easier it is to cheat
* taking a pencil from work vs taking 50cents from the petty cash
* when we deal with money, we are primed to think about out actions as if we had just signed an honor code

Beer and free lunches
* announcing orders in public alters the choices (in some societies people want to feel unique, in others people want to belong to the grouop)
* plan your order before the waiter arrives
* basis of free lunches: providing benefits for all the parties involved
