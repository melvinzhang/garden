> But the science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially,
is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value; just as
logic has its own peculiar truth and value, independently of the subjects
to which we may apply its reasonings and processes.

> Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds
in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of
such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and
scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.

> We may say most aptly, that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves.

> The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.
