speaker: Brady Forrest
event: FOSSASIA 2017

Worked with 74 different hardware companies
* software wrapped in plastic
* special sauce is the software

Moving towards more B2B as B2C is flash in the pants

** Hardware is not software
* takes a while to get it in a working state

Scaling hardware
* prototype
  * best teams is 3-5
* validation
  * hardware accelerator
* product design
  * design for manufacturing
  * margin stack
* manufacturing
  * testing apparatus
* scale
  * distribution

Funding gap, hard to raise enough funds to get to the point of shipping

** You need to get feedback from customers as soon as possible

Prototype, test, and iterate
* compression stockings

Prototype is concept, form, and experience

** Crowdfunding will not ship your product

Instacube did not account for DFM, could not build and ship for the original price.
