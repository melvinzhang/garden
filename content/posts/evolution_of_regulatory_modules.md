** Comparing S. cerevisiae and S. pombe
 * Regulatory modules: group of co-expressed, co-regulated genes
 * Conserved transcription modules in E. Coli and Human
 * Adaptation of regulatory modules in S. cerevisiae and S. pombe?
 * Find modules using bi clustering, comparing modules between two species -> orthologous modules
 * Look at tf binding sites of the modules
** Include more species and putative modules
 * construct a phylogenetic profile of binding sites
 * parsimonious reconstruction of ancestral binding sites
 * eg, from Homol-D to RAP1
** Evolution of regulatory modules
 * cis-buffering in modules
 * how do novel sites emerge and invade many genes
 * neutral drift
 * selective advantage to redundancy
 * undefined selective role
** Reconstructing orthogroups
** Phylogeny of modules
