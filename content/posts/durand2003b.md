Vertebrate evolution: doubling and shuffling with a full deck

Challenges: small, noisy datasets, lack of computational accuracy and
statistical rigor

Ken Wolfe et al. presented a genome-scale, statistically rigorous analysis of
evidence base on spatial organization of duplicated genes and estimates of
duplication times.

[McLysaht2002] is based on a comprehensive spatial and temporal approach.
Monte Carlo significance testing to validate spatial results, two different
methods to estimate gene duplication times.

Testable predictions of the 2R hypothesis are based on spatial or temporal
evidence.

However, conserved synteny between paralogous genes does not constitute
rigorous proof of polyploidization without statistical analysis.

Temporal predictions are based on estimates of gene duplication times and gene
family topologies. Estimated gene duplication times should show two distinct
waves early in the vertebrate lineage. Assumes a constant molecular clock.
