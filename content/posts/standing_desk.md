{"title": "Standing desk", "tags": []}

My current setup is IKEA coffee table on top of desk, as shown in
[The Standesk 2200](https://alphacolin.com/ikea-standing-desk-for-22-dollars/)

Standing allows me to move freely and if I need to move to get something, I
don't have to "get up" from my chair.

I've always found sitting in a chair uncomfortable afer a while and have
considered getting better chairs. I've used an exercise ball as a chair for a
while and it is an improvement over a regular chair.

Then I had the insight that getting rid of sitting altogether is a more elegant
solution.
