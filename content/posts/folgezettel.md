Luhmann's ZK had high level subject areas which emerged over time

"Links or references do not emphasize the relationship between notes"
"Folgezettel, however, create specific relationships â€“ adding manual links (references) to these relationships create relationship of relationships"
"all notes in a note sequence are on the same level. There are no categories."
