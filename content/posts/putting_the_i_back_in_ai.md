Ability to improvise
* understand cause and effect

Innate capacities
* people, places, and things

Learning in the factory vs Learnig in the wild

Build in some structures, learn the rest
* make infinite use of finite (learned) means
* e.g. convolution assumes locality, then we compose the local pieces
* what are other structural ideas like this?

Finding a middle ground between a pile of code and a pile of neural goo
* start with hand written control and planning
* learning about the world vs learning how to reason

How can a competent robot acquire a new ability
* pouring liquid from one container to another
* gaussian process to drive sampling during planning and learning
* 2d simulation of making coffee using pouring, stirring, pushing

Advances in planning from STRIPS
* handling discrete and continuous variables
* handling uncertainty in the robot's model of the environment
* hierachical planning
