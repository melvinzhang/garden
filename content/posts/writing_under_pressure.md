Guest blogging for the NUS SoC blog has taught me that it is important to set
some goals for blogging. Having only one week to write made me think hard about
the topics I wanted to cover in the limited time.Â  I contributed a total of
five posts, which you can find [here](http://nusschoolofcomputing.blogspot.com/search/label/Melvin%20Zhang).
I'm not sure what will happen to the NUS SoC blog in the future, so I'm
considering moving my posts to this blog for safe keeping.

The ability to write well is critical to doing research, because the best ideas
are useless unless they can be communicated to the larger community. It is not
just about describing your idea but also providing the right amount of
background information and motivation to the reader so that he/she can
appreciate its usefulness.
