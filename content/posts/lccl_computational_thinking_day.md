{"title": "LCCL Computational thinking day", "tags": ["contrib"]}

Discussed with Juliana, Thomas, Hon Wai on 2022/01/23 at NEWest

March - announcement, promoting
June - 1 week camp
Sept - 1 day workshop
Nov - actual day

Goal is to promote Computational Thinking
Participants must develop and present their plan first, then do the implementation.

Will have tasks for both Scratch and Python

Scratch
* ignore running time, maybe give a scoring scheme
* https://open.kattis.com/problems/apples
  * score by number of apples in the correct location
