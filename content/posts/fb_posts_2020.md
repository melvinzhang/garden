Oct 29: DBS getting into digital asset trading for institutions. Either someone messed up and made the page live too early or it is a sneaky new marketing strategy. Seems to be a genuine mistake as they have removed all the cached copies of said page.

Jul 25: Fighting games have great depth to them but often make it hard to pull off the special moves. Fantasy Strike solves that by making all the moves easy to execute, moving the emphasis to the decision making. The F2P model is fair, pay for cosmetics/extra game modes.

Jul 10: TIL about James Ryan's "Talk of the town" which "generates an American small town and simulates its history (day by day) over the course of 200 years, with an emphasis on social exchanges and the internal lives of characters." There was supposed to be a game set in this town, but it was not completed. Details of the social simulation of the town is described in http://www.gameaipro.com/GameAIPro3/GameAIPro3_Chapter37_Simulating_Character_Knowledge_Phenomena_in_Talk_of_the_Town.pdf Ref: https://www.jamesryan.world/projects#/talktown/

Jun 21: TIL: MUD2 (1985) has a much more detailed simulation (akin to Dwarf Fortress) as compared to modern MMOs/CRPGs. Quote: "So when I talk about physics, it is this kind of thing. Light cannot pass through a closed wooden door. Most MMOs don’t have doors these days. Or what happens when you pour four pints of water into a three pint container. Most MMOs don’t do this. And plate armor doesn’t float."

Mar 18: "AlphaGo (the documentary) chronicles a journey from the halls of Oxford, through the backstreets of Bordeaux, past the coding terminals of Google DeepMind in London, and ultimately, to the seven-day tournament in Seoul. As the drama unfolds, more questions emerge: What can artificial intelligence reveal about a 3000-year-old game? What can it teach us about humanity?" -- https://www.alphagomovie.com/

Feb 22: A phishing live video recommended by YouTube's algorithm. Scams are getting more innovative, even the live chat comments are faked. If it is too good to be true, it probably is. Ref: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDcNAkJpDn0
