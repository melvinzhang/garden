** Identify function modules across species via orthology
 * project modules via gene orthology
 * SAMBA -> BLAST to find gene orthology <- SAMBA
 * conserved function modules are regulated by conserved promoter elements
 * evolution of motifs -> transfer of function
 * modes of motif evolution
 ** conservation
 ** BS evolution
 ** trans switching
 ** full switching
 ** program enrichment
 ** program abridgement
 ** switching/buffering
 * conclusion: redundancy leads to evolvability

** Characterize substitutions
 * Kellis et al 2003, Cliften et al 2003
 * form phylogeny of sequence, collect statistics about substitutions
 * infer substitution rates among pairs of motifs (all 8-mers in promoter region)
 * from graph of motifs with 2 types of edges, high substitution rate and low substitution rate
 * plot substitution rate vs normal -> enriched in low sub
 * plot conservation rate vs normal -> enriched in high conservation
 * clusters => TFBS

** Modeling of evolution and learning
 * epistatic intervals
