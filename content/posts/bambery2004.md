FITR applied to study chemical changes as result of cervical cancer.

Comparison with H&E stained samples.

Spectra that passed a quality test were converted to second derivative spectra
using a Savitsky-Golay algorithm and were then vertor normalized over the
1800-950cm^-1 region. The process of conversion into second derivative spectra
eliminates the need for baseline correction of the normal spectra.
