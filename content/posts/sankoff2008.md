Title: Internal Validation of Ancestral Gene Order Reconstruction in Angiosperm Phylogeny
 * Distance = Number of genes - number of cycles
 * whole genome duplication (Tetraploidization)
 ** WGD, followed by rearrangement and gene loss
 * genome halving (reverse of WGD), can be solved in O(n) time/space but have multiple solutions
 * guided genome halving using outgroup
