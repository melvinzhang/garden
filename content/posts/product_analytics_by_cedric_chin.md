Dave McClure
*** acquisition
*** activation
*** retention

focus on activation and retention at the start
** Activation
what is an active user?
*** create a funnel
sign up - verify email - key activity - active user
*** multiple types of active users
 * casual users
 * core users
*** types of users as a state machine
growth hacking as shifting users to active
** Retention
cohorts, active users in a certain week
correlates with how much a user loves your product
** tension between user experience and growth
** aggregate is a lossy compression
** quantitative = what? qualitative = why?
** how do you know what you believe is true?
** data isn't enough
need to be part of development cycle to drive product decision
** organizational process is the other
generate hypotheses of why feature change cause metrics change
triage base on ease of verification and value to company
** test the hypotheses
 * user testing
 * contact users/user interviews
 * A/B testing
