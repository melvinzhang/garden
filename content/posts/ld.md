## Session 53: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner
* Three Squares: The Invention of the American Meal
* see https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2015/03/against-meals-breakfast-lunch-dinner/
* started in the middle ages, Europe
* Europeans considered the natives who did not have meal time as uncivilized. Civilized people ate at meal time, differentiating them from animals where grazing is the norm.
* Pre industrial revolution, breakfast was cold dishes, lunch was a heavier meal, cooked, dinner was similar to breakfast
* Post industrial revolution, people work away from home, so lunch became a more casual affair and dinner was the cooked meal
* Folks were still easting as much as when they were farming so nutritionists began advising for a lighter breakfast, Kellogs jumped onto this an introduced corn flakes
* Then fruit-growers associated sized the opportunity to market fruit juices which contains the newly discovered vitamins
* Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, no scientific backing, no effect on metabolism or weight loss
* 3 v 6 meals, 2 v 5 meals, no weight or hormonal differences

* Quotes from AAL's notes at the end of her translation

> But the science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially,
is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value; just as
logic has its own peculiar truth and value, independently of the subjects
to which we may apply its reasonings and processes.

> Supposing, for instance, that the fundamental relations of pitched sounds
in the science of harmony and of musical composition were susceptible of
such expression and adaptations, the engine might compose elaborate and
scientific pieces of music of any degree of complexity or extent.

> We may say most aptly, that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraical patterns just as the Jacquard-loom weaves flowers and leaves.

> The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.

## Session 38: Setting up a home gym
* About the cost of 1 year of gym membership for basic setup with
  * barbell

## Session 32: Turing and the Typewriter

* Typewriter as the inspiration for the first model of computation, Turing's a-machine
  'a' stands for automatic
