dynamic dag reachability
* A fully dynamic reachability algorithm for directed graphs with an almost linear update time

Undirected connectivity in log-space

`O(sqrt(|V|)E)` for matching by running BFS on all free vertices in parallel

MST in O(n)?

Alternative path - start and end in free vertex

Augmenting path - score of unmatch > match

Planar graph iff contains `K_5` or `K_(3,3)`

`A^k[i,j]` is number of walks from `v_i` to `v_j`
