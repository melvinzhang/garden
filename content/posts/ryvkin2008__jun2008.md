Title: Duplication Mechanism and Disruptions in Flanking Regions Influence the Fate of Mammalian Gene Duplicates

Title: Estimating the Relative Contributions of New Genes from Retrotransposition and Segmental Duplication Events during Mammalian Evolution

DNA mediated (segmental duplications, SD)

RNA mediated duplications (retro transposion, RT)

use local synteny (+/- 3 genes on each side) to distinguish orthologs

FP/FN  rate, Inparanoid, Ensembl

BranchClust - orthologous groups
