Title: Discovering biomolecular mechanisms with computational biology

Fundamental problem in life sciences
large number of functionally uncharacteried genes, yet to be discovered
functions/structures/pathways

Biomolecular function discovery
ANNIE - wet lab - sequence analysis

Proteins consists of globular and non-globular domains.

Globular domains: significant sequence similarity, annotation transfer from
homologous groups of proteins

Non-globular domains: repetitive patterns

Protein sequence analysis
# mask out non globular regions
# determine occurrence of known domains
# search distant homologs for remaining segments
