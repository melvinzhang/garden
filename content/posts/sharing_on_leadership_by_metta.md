Good leaders inspire others to follow the vision/goal
* provides clarity
* communicate to the audience
* provide space to grow
* listen, figure out where the team is at

Frequent communication, open door, flat hierachy

Changes create uncertainty/insecurity
* be transparent
* what is the worst that can happen?
* move people from a place of fear/insecurity to a curious/open/playful mindset
  * make it into a challenge/game/puzzle

Uncomforable with giving feedback
* normal to be uncomfortable, it is about helping the other person improve
* 360-degree feedback, do it regularly. Everyone has to do it, a shared experience.

How to help someone figure out what they need to grow?
* listen to them, give them assignments to push them

Biggest ROI decision
* hiring someone who works well with you, shared values

Lowest ROI decision
* too ambitious and not enough resources to support it
* mispriced the cost of getting into a partnership

Biggest leadership mistake
* hiring when there are red flags
* let bad behavior go on for too long, affects morale
