I've been revisiting some code I wrote a couple of months ago in order to
implement some new ideas. It is amazing how much information you need to keep
in your head to even start working on a modification of existing code. It took
me a while to get used to the code again, thankfully I had written some simple
comments.

At the point of writing the program, writing comments seems like a waste of
time because all the information is already at your fingertips, but if you try
to work on the program again after a while, you will find the comments
invaluable.
