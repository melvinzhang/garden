** AI is whatever that hasn't been done yet
** How much water is flowing through the river?
** Missing data
equipment failure
out of power
** Use machine learning to fill in the missing data
** Process based models vs Data driven models
Use knowledge of hydrology to model the physical processes vs
Use collected data to infer the model from the data
** Classify regions on a map into the category it belongs to
** Predicting streamflow from rainfall and temperature
*** Linear regression
streamflow = A x rainfall + B x temperature + C
*** Decision tree
*** Neural network
*** SVM
** Additional additional variables
streamflow before, after
rainfall before, after, average
** Different variations
proximal training - use only recent data instead of all data
model seasons separately as the data is different across seasons
