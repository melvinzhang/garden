** Mechanisms responsible for duplicated genes
tandem repeat through slippage during recombination

gene conversion

horizontal transfer and other transposition

hybridization

duplication of entire segments of chromosomes

temporary (auto or allo) tetraploidy leading, through process of
diploidization, to an effective doubling of the whole genome

** Fate of duplicated genes
both copies exist with high sequence identify, leading to increased expression

one copy is suppressed, either by physical deletion or by accumulating point
mutation until it becomes a pseudo gene

random mutations may cause at least one of the copies to diverge functionally
(novel role or specializing)

** Segmental duplications
many duplicated genes are part of larger duplicated segments

two kinds: recent duplications (>90% sequence similarity), sets of genes (not
necessarily contiguous, may be separated by long stretches of unrelated
sequences)

[[Venter2001]]: three or more pairs of paralogous genes in relative close
proximity on two different genomes, found more than 1000 such blocks, most of
them containing >= 5 genes

** WGD
[[Wolfe1997]]: establishment of a rigorous protocol for proving a doubling
event in yeast, whether a pattern of segmental duplications in a genome is
evidence either for or against tetraploidization

process of diploidization, where a tetraploid is returned to the normal state
of diploidy

[[Arabidopsis2000]] gave convincing analysis showing that the Arabidopsis
genome was duplicated ~112 Myr ago, with no evidence of multiple independent
segmental duplication events or mutliple episodes of whole-genome duplication

This is supported by a relatively sharp peak in an indepenent estiamate of
duplication times

=== Whether the vertebrate lineage, leading to the jawed fishes and eventually
to humans, underwent two rounds of genome duplication? ===

both [[Venter2001]] and [[Human2001]] mention extensive segmental duplications
but declare that current analyses are insufficient to determine whether they
are the result of two whole-genome doubling or larger number of unrelated
duplications of chromosomal segments.

Evidence in favor [[Wang2000]] [[Gibson2000]] [[Holland1999]] [[Holland2001]]
of the doubling hypothesis, against [[Martin2001]] [[Hughes1999]]
[[Friedman2001]] [[Hughes2001]]

[[McLysaght2002]] gave evidence for a highly significant prevalence of
segmental duplications in a relatively short time frame ~450 Myr ago,
suggesting at least one round of tetraploidization

Critical assessment of the available data suggested in [[Wolfe2001]]
