Jan 19: "In contrast to all recent developments that rely on sophisticated continuous optimization methods and dynamic algorithms, our algorithm is simple: it requires only a simple graph decomposition and elementary combinatorial tools. In fact, ours is the first combinatorial algorithm for negative-weight SSSP to break through the classic O(mâˆšnlogW) bound from over three decades ago" -- https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03456
