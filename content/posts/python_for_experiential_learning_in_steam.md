{"title": "Python for experiential learning in STEAM", "tags": ["talk"]}
event: PyCon APAC Edu summit
speaker: Praveen Patil, GS Science College

Problems in science classes
* passive learning
* exam oriented
* lack of equipment
* learning concepts that are impossible to see
* no scope for exploration and experiential learning

Taking lab to the classroom
* Arvind Gupta toys
* Python
* ExpEYES - Pocket Science Lab
* PSLab

Example: teaching electricity
* magnet moving through copper coils
* connect it to LED
* connect it to PSLab to plot the voltage

Example: python for understanding equations
* y = sin(3x)
* y = x sin(3x)

Example: mechanics of spring
Example: coupled pendulums
