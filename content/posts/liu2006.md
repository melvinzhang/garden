** Background
spatial temporal regulation

gene network (G -> G) as a simplification of cellular network
(G -> P -> M, M -> P, M -> G, P -> G)

** Learning gene network
 * pairwise correlation
 * boolean models
 * linear models
 * nonlinear models
 * differential models
 * bayesian models
 * causal influence
 * data of a stochastic nature
 * small datasets

** Challenges
 * large number of dimensions
 * noise
 * randomness

** Learning strategy for Bayesian models
*** candidate parent selection
 * typically using pairwise correlation
 * problems: weak parents, gene/protein complexes, variable time delay

*** determine actual parents using heuristics
*** CD algorithm
use CRE to find weak parents in candidate parent selection
 * conditional dependence: A -> C <- B, if C is known, A and B are dependent
 * conditional relative entropy (CRE)

find complexes in candidate parent set of z
 * complexes as semi clique
 * each semi clique of size 4 contains a clique of size 3
 ** first find all 3 cliques by brute force
 ** use heuristics to extend the 3 cliques to semi cliques

use complexes and individual genes to check for parents
