Einstein 1905
* laws of electromagnetism should be consistent with the principle of relativity
* spacetime interval (ds)^2 = (dt)^2 - (dx)^2

Minkowski diagram 1908
* https://dudarion.github.io/Interactive-Minkowski-diagram/

train and track frame of reference
* fire two beams from the center of the train to the ends
* observer on the train, both beam reach the ends at the same time
* observer on the track, the beam reaches the back of the train first

Sagnac effect
* due to rotation
* sync two clocks on earth, take one east/west around the earth
* two clocks will be out of sync

Explains electromagnetism
* a positive charge moving in the same direction as the electons
  * in its frame, the positive charges are moving and due to length contraction
  * the denser positive charge leads to repulsion
* when moving in opposite direction, attraction occurs due to the denser electrons
* magnetic field in our frame becomes electic field

spacetime interval of two events
* two events separated by distance D and time T where (cT)^2 = D^2
  * then it also satisfies this equation in all frames since c = D/T
* more generally if two events have (cT)^2 - D^2 = s^2, this value s^2 is invariant
* in all frames
  * s^2 > 0 are timelike separated, there is a frame they occur at the same place
    * s is the time interval in that frame!
  * s^2 < 0 are spacelike separated, there is a frame they occur at the same time
  * s^2 = 0 are lightlight separated, a single photo may be present at both events
* all observers agree about which pairs of events are causal!

time dilation explained with light clock
* light travels further in the moving clock
* muons have a 1.5 microsecond halflife but detected on earth's surface
  * time dilation from our perspective
  * length contraction from the muon's perspective

* time dilation
* length contraction
* speed of causality
