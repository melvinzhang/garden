** Linear Programming
 * minimizing a linear objective function, subject to a finite number of linear equality and inequality constraints
 * network flow, MST is linear programming
 * constraints define a feasible set, optimal solution occurs at corner of feasible set
 * forms of LP
 ** canonical form $\min cx$ subject to $Ax \ge r, x \ge 0$
 ** standard form $\min cs$ subject to $Ax = 0, x \ge 0$, may need to introduce slack variables
