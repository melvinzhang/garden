Computational transportation science

Traffic assignment is the demand on each road.

To understand the effects of modern intelligent routing on traffic

Every driver wants the fastest route for himself. Each driver's choice of routes affect other drivers.

Agenda:
* construct a simulation framework
* use OpenStreetMap
* existing traffic simulators, eg MatSim

* run simulation experiments to search for traffic patterns resulting from selfish routing

* prove results concerning these results

* study algorithmic mechanisms for reduing traffic congestion, by influencing vehicle routing choices
