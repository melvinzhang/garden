Explores how co-expression various as a function of the distance on the
genome.

There are well-defined long-range  correlations and this is true for all
genes, regardless of their localization.

There are also short-range correlations that correspond to DNA turns on the
nucleoid surface.

A model of the the nucleoid solenoid structure based on two spirals was
proposed to explain the observations.
