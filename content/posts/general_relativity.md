extends special relativty by including the effect of gravity

equivalence principle
* free falling in gravity ~ free floating in space
* standing in gravity ~ an accelerating frame

Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker spacetime
* Space is homogeneous and isotropic
* Space is uniformly filled with matter

mass warps spaccetime
* Schwarzschild radius, r_s = 2GM/c^2
* (ds)^2 = (1 - r_s/r)(cdt)^2 - (1 + r_s/r)(dx)^2
* time slows in curved space time
  * consider a clock on a rotating space station with artifical gravity

curvature of time causes gravity
* time curvature dominates for weak gravitational field and objects at low velocity
* see Newtonian limit

why does mass warp light
* light has no velocity in the time dimension
* consider a space ship shooting a laser perpendicular to its motion
  * to the outside observer the light moves in a straight line
  * to the inside observer the light moves in a curve

inconsistent with quantum mechanics
* in QM a particle can be in multiple places, what happen to its gravity?
