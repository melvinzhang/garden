We live in an age where information is readily accessible. Note-taking is an
important skill to develop personal insights and in-depth understanding.
Unfortunately, it is often not thought of as a crucial skill and we often do it
in a haphazard manner. Niklas Luhmann, a prolific German sociologist, developed
an extensive note-taking system of index cards, Zettelksaten, to help him
remember and develop new ideas. Today we have several digital tools that
implement the key ideas of his Zettelkasten system.
