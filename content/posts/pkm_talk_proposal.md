Title: Level up your note taking skills and cultivate new ideas

Alt title: Building a personal knowledge mangement tool in Vim

# Elevator Pitch (300 chars)

Do you struggle to remember what you've learned? I took notes for every talk I
attended, but it was hard to find them again. Then I learned about the
Zettelkasten method and its modern incarnation, Digital Gardens. Learn how to
create your own digital garden to learn in public and develop new ideas.

# Topic background

We live in an age where information is readily accessible. Note-taking is an
important skill to develop personal insights and in-depth understanding.
Unfortunately, it is often not thought of as a crucial skill and we often do it
in a haphazard manner. Niklas Luhmann, a prolific German sociologist, developed
an extensive note-taking system of index cards, Zettelksaten, to help him
remember and develop new ideas. Today we have several digital tools that
implement the key ideas of his Zettelkasten system.

# Scope of presentation

1. Explanation of the key insights behind the Zettelkasten method.
2. How to make notes that matter and publish them on your own digital garden.
3. Use the garden to cultivate new ideas and share them with others.
