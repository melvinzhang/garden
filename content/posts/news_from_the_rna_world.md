** Annotation of ncRNA
 * transcriptiome complexity of the Hox A cluster
 * novel small RNA families, promoter and termini associated RNAS, Science 316:1484-1488 (2007)
 * annotation of ncRNAs: homology search based on sequence and/or structure, clustering
 * finding ncRNA on the genome: known ncRNAs are more stable than genomic
background, certain base pairings must be conserved to preserve the secondary
structure
 * structure conservation index, z-score, sequence alignment score can be used to search for structured ncRNA
 * machine learning approaches for specific families: micro RNAs, snoRNAs
 * structure-based clustering
** Evolution of microRNA
 * protein coding genes are old, few new transcription factor were invented through vertebrate evolution, whereas small RNAs, in particular microRNAs, are new
 * link between ncRNA innovation and novelty at the organismal level
 * expansion of the Metazoan microRNA repertoire during evolution
