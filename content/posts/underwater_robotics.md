OceanOneK by Ousama Khatib, talk at NUS 26th Aug 2-3:30pm.

Started with Romeo and Julient, compliant robotics.

OceanOne went to 100m

OceanOneK went to 852m. Using glass microspheres foam.

Learning from human motion, using a hierachy of controllers instead of moving to a high dimension space for motion plannning.

Robots have lower sensor latency compared to humans, but we use prediction to overcome the latency.
