GEMS2 system
* GO enrichment analysis
* KS test with reference library
* return top 10 best results

Original vs Improvement
human - ortholog conversion and applied to other species
GO modules - KEGG modules or self-defined
Thousands of modules - ~200 modules
Need module enrichment analysis - no need as fewer modules
Cmap database - added disease database

Uses Roundup method to find orthologs (Tong Yuan Juan Huan)

Some additional reference databases

Test with a specific mouse gene expression

Application with X1 treatment and expression to find related gene modules and
from there find that X1 is related to PPAR signalling, verify with protein
docking exp.

Integrated into GEMS2 online and can be downloaded.
