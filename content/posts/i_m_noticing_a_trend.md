Whenever I'm experimenting with web based software, I will usually try to
install it on a server. After some time, I will get tired of maintaining the
system and start looking for free hosting services on the web. This happened to
the blogging software I've been using. I started with a blog plugin for
[dokuwiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org/), but theÂ  number of other plugins I had to
install just to get some basic blogging functionalities was crazy.

WordPress seems like a nice platform, it is open source and there is a easy way
to export the posts from the system so that you are not locked in. Over the
next few days I will be migrating my old posts over here.
