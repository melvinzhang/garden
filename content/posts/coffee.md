Tried Vietnamese coffee at Fat Saigon Boy outlet in Science Park

Brewed with a metal filter (phin), see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HURkJz9N0QI

In Singapore, phin and Vietnamese coffee power are imported by [Mei Le Pte Ltd](https://meile.com.sg/products)

Ratio of water to coffee should be about 14-18:1, consider 17:1 for drip coffee brewing

Ground coffee is cheaper per gram as compared to coffee powder in prepackaged filter bags

Coffee interferes with cortisol production. Morning is not the best time as cortisol should be high.
Prefer mid-morning/early afternoon (9-11am), before 2-3pm.
