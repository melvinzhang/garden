French in Singapore for 5 years

Too cold because of too much airon?
* 96.5% said yes out of thousand of responders

Air conditioning consumes 36% of total household energy

Importance of communicating the impact in an easy to understand metric
For one HDB flat, needs 300 trees to absorb CO2 due to air con.

Why Singapore? Small country, big impact

Antartica is melting but we don't feel it here.
Go to Antartica and report back

About a hundred people went, in teams of 9.
Many nationalities, no conflicts, everyone followed orders.

Minimum 5 meters away from the wildlife. Penguin, seals, orca.

If all of Antartica melts, sea levels will rise by 60m.

Why don't people change the temperature?
* First reason: cannot control
* Don't want to feel paiseh
* Aircon must be cold, known as "leng qi"
* Government will take care of it

Increase your aircon temperature by 2 degrees, so that the planet don't have to do it

Simple ways: put a sticker indicating the right temperature
It is not illegal if the sticker can be removed without leaving a mark.

Pushed for BCA to have building be set to 23 - 25 degrees. Adopted in Dec 2016.

Focus on scalable initiatives.
