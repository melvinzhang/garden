** Problem statement
 * translation of medical guidelines
 * sources of uncertainty
 ** lack of info
 ** probabilistic nature
 ** conflicting information
** Fuzzy logic (Degree of truth)
 * fuzzification
 * fuzzy inference
 * defuzzification
** Inexact reasoning (Degree of belief in rules)
 * level of evidence of guidelines
 * confirmation (strength of belief)
 ** classification
 ** comparative
 ** quantitative
 * Probablity is not suitable here because
 ** p(a) + p(not a) != 1
 ** evidence may support hypothesis but not contrapositive
 * Measures of belief/disbelief
 * Certainty Factor = Measure of belief - Measure of disbelief
 * deals with conflicting rules
