TITLE: Identification of conserved gene clusters via whole genome analysis

A review paper that includes future research topics, for the Graduate Research Paper part of NUS CS PhD.

** Follow up
presentation on gene cluster discovery to CBL and friends, let Limsoon know
when it a good time

Limsoon suggested submitting as a survey paper to JBCB

gene clusters for predicting protein function/protein-protein interaction
prediction (possible joint work with Kenny)

data mining techniques (frequent itemset, sequence mining) in gene cluster
discovery (possible joint work with Guimei)

info fusion (see paper from Kenny)
