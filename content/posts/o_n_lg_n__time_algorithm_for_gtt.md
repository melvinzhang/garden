{"title": "O(n lg n) time algorithm for GTT", "tags": ["paper"]}
Wang2013 proposed an almost O(n lg n) time algorithm. The gap of
$\alpha(n)$ can be reduced with a better data structure. The goal is
to be able to partition in linear time.

The data structure should maintain a sequence of integers, and support
the following operations: max, delete head, delete tail, delete ith
