Geary's C
\[
C = \frac{N-1 \sum_i \sum_j w_{ij} (X_i - X_j)^2}{2 W \sum_i (X_i - E(X))^2}
\]
where N is the number of spatial units indexed by i and j, X is the variable of interest, $w_{ij}$ is a spatial weight matrix and W is the sum of all $w_{ij}$

Ratio of two bands is $\frac{b_1 - b_2}{b_1 + b_2}$
