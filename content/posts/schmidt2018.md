Luhmann's numbering is not hierarchical in nature as sub-topics may diverge from the
parent topic. It is only an indication of the current train of thought.

Numbering though alternate numbers and letters to represent an extensible tree structure.

Three types of links:
* overview of a subject
* outline for a train of thought
* direct reference

Keyword index serve as an entrypoint into the system. Only directly links to a few starting points for that keyword

“Underlying the filing technique is the experience that without writing, there is no thinking.”
-- Luhmann, Zettelkasten II, index card no. 9/8g
