{"title": "Median of three genomes with sequences/traces", "tags": ["contrib"]}

Worked with Zhou Zhong on this paper, published in International Journal of Modern Physics

Find the median of three genomes given
* one sorting sequence for each pair of genomes
* all possible optimal sorting sequences for each pair of genomes

Changiz Eslahchi suggested using boostrapping to check which scenario of rooted tree is more likely
