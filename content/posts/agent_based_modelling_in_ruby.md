Programs for exploration of natural systems
** Boids by Craig Reynolds
model animal motions through three simple rules
** Modelling money
roids have energy, have to seek out food to replenish energy
small population of the roids have most of the energy
** Adding sex -> birth and death
roids have gender
can give birth to new roids
roids have a lifespan
** Natural selections
add metabolism and vision range
roid babies inherit these 2 attributes from their parents
** Inheritance of energy
when a roid dies, its collected energy passed on to its children
attributes take more time to increase, compared to without inheritance
