I'm guest blogging for the [NUS SoC blog](http://nusschoolofcomputing.blogspot.com/) this week. Btw, I really enjoyed Bruce's [postings on gaming](http://nusschoolofcomputing.blogspot.com/search/label/Bruce%20Chia), do check it out. On a related note, there is another interesting blog by an NUS SoC student at [Life of a NUS Computing Student](http://life-of-a-nus-computing-student.blogspot.com/), some of the observations are rather funny and insightful.
