{"title": "Note taking", "tags": []}

My learnings
* notes to develop lines of thought not an archive
  * see https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/
* siloed notes, not making connections between notes
  * connections are important, many insights are about connecting two separate ideas
* integrate readings by breaking it down into separate notes, one per idea

[Zettelkasten method](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/)
* aka 卡片盒笔记法
* for developing thoughts, not building an archive
* used by Niklas Luhmann
* unique id for each note
  * hierachical numbering
  * does not seem to be used today, instead a timestamp is used
  * debate about note sequence [Folgezettel]({{< relref "folgezettel" >}})
* tags, body with links, references
* links should explain the relationship
* see [Schmidt2018]({{< relref "schmidt2018" >}}) [How to Take Smart Notes]({{< relref "how_to_take_smart_notes" >}})

[Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes)
* atomic
* concept-oriented
* densely linked
* prefer associative ontologies to hierarchical taxonomies
* write notes for yourself by default, disregarding audience

[Manfred Kuehn's digital ZK](https://www.connectedtext.com/manfred.php)
* found wiki to be the right fit, easy linking and one thought/fact
* prefer association over hierachy
* prefer wiki links to using numbered ids
* Mills' "On Intellectual Craftsmanship"
* write in your own words
* [blog archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20201021201608/https://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/)

Beatrice Webb Appendix C: The art of note-taking
* break up reading into individial cards and rearrange them
* atomicity: one sheet one subject-matter/event
* date, source of information
* finding the best arrangemet of notes is part of the discovery process
