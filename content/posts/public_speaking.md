** Common problems
 * Lack of confidence

 ** set an agenda, what you want to achieve in a talk
 * Nervousness
 ** Your audience will be accommodating of your mistakes if you are trying your best
 ** body language: eyes, smile, hands
 * Insensitivity or disrespect
 * Not public speaking
 ** do not read or memorize and rote-speak
 * Fear of the audience
 ** by encouraged by friendly faces, and glace at them for confidence
** Four importance areas
*** Time phases
 * pre-speech: understanding who you audience members will be, numbers, educational level
 * during the speech: create interest by using active and concise language, speak at an appropriate pace, volume and language
 * post-speech: getting feedback helps you improve
*** Organization of speech
 * "Today I'm going to speak about ...", cue the audience, give an overview
 * work in your introduction, choose a concise statement, quote, ancedote or a question
 * move from point to point in oral paragraphs, separated by noticeable pauses
 * conclude with a summary, capturing the essence of what you've delivered
*** Style(s)
 * decide on combination of seriousness and humor
 * use body language effectively to suit your personality
 * punctuate and emphasize using both voice and body language
 * avoid distracting mannerisms, repetitive actions and unconcious habits
 * engage individuals through eye contact
*** Question and answer
 * if there are different approaches, mention them and say what you would do and why
 * if a participant disagrees with you, acknowledge the point and explain why you have your stand without arguing
The audeience only listens to you speech, it is important to be clear and accurate. Aim to leave a vivid impression and a lasting one.
