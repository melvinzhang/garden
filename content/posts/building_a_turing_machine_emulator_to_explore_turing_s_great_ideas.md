{"title": "Building a Turing Machine emulator to explore Turing\u2019s great ideas", "tags": ["contrib"]}

Turing’s classic 1936 paper launched the field of Computer Science by
introducing the Turing Machine model of computation. The popular retelling of
Turing’s work focuses on the halting problem but Turing prefer his machines to
never halt. His demonstration of a universal turing machine showed that
software can be separated from hardware and paved the way for the
stored-program computer.

In this talk, we will develop our own Turing Machine emulator and execute some
of Turing’s machines and show how his ideas shaped our understanding of
Programming and Computer Science.
