** Biology
 * AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK)
 ** related to muscle cellular energy status
 * degree of activation/deactivation of subunits isoforms
 * current analysis is on single experiment

** Problem
Make use of experimental results to:
 * discover correlation between stimuli and state
 * discover correlation between different states

** Items
 * Stimulus item, annotated with +++, ++, +, - to indicate level of intensity
 * State item, annotated with `uarr`, |, `darr`

** Impact
 * demonstrating former experiments via matching more experimental results
 * predicting potential results based on existing conditions
 * guiding design of future experiments
