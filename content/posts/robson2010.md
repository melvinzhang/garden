[Active Teaching and Learning](http://w3.gre.ac.uk/~bj61/talessi/atl.html)

# What is active teaching and learning (ATL)
Involves the use of strategies that maximise opportunities for interaction. As
opposed to so-called transmission methods (formal, didactic, expository and
teacher-centered approaches such as lectures). ATL encourages interaction
between teachers and students, amongst students, and between students and the
materials.

Strategies that promote active learning are:
* small group work
* research based projects
* case studies
* discussions
* role play
* field trips

# Pros
* activities are energising and engaging, so there is a high level of participation
* makes use of prior experience or knowledge
* discussions promote adoption of new perspectives ans positions
* debate on values and assumptions from different viewpoints
* openness with respect to learning outcomes
* peer support and learning
* critical reflection on action and experience
* greater ownership of and responsibility for learning
* development of generic communicative skills

# Cons
* shortage of time
* professional bodies' constraints
* teachers' view of their role
* student groups may be dysfunctional
* emotional risk may be too great
* experience may be emphasised at the expense of abstract thought
* student access to teacher's expertise may be decreased
* teachers may feel they lack the expertise or confidence

# Theoretical justifications
\subsection{Motivation, curiosity and activity}
Interest and learning are intimately related.  There is a built-in tendency to
notice and react to novelty. \emph{Competence or effectance motivation} is the
motivation we have towards effective interaction with our environment.
\emph{Cognitive commitment} refers to our tendency to complete new cognitive
projects.  The tendency to completion is strong.

It is important to understand the role of interest and motivation in effective
learning.   Capitalize human desire to interact with our environment, on our
curiosity and on the energising effect of activity itself.

\subsection{Language varieties and `encoding'}
A \emph{register} is a variety of language defined according to its \emph{use},
while a \emph{dialect} is defined according to user. The language variety our
student use may not be the language of the institution or of the academic
subject they are studying.

The student's own language variety and they way they use language is an
important part of their identity.   If we wish to help build self-esteem, we
need to take this into account.

Students need opportunities to use their own language varieties so that they can
achieve what is referred to as `deep learning' (de-coding vs en-coding).
Opportunities to re-work new knowledge or ideas into meaningful forms through
encoding are essential for effective learning.

\subsection{Learning from experience}
David Kolb was interested in `deep learning', which is learning that is
concerned with extracting principles and underlying meanings to make sense of
facts and feelings and to integrate them with previously acquired knowledge.
`Surface learning' is rote learning.  Kolb's model of experiential learning has
four stages arranges in a cycle: concrete experience - reflective observation -
abstract conceptualization - active experimentation

\subsection{Contestable knowledge}
Our job is to teach no so much `bodies of knowledge' as \emph{critical
thinking}, and the adoption of a critical stance towards taken-for-granted
knowledge.   Knowledge should be seen as culturally and historically specific,
sustained by social processes and interactions.  Active learning gives students
a change to debate and contest underlying assumptions and values and promotes
openness in relation to learning outcome.
