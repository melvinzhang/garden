monitoring
* water quality
* landslides
combines geographic information and satellite to generate 3d city models
suggest routes for ships based on sea conditions and wind
oil, gas, and mining
** stabilization
Bdot, generate magnetic field to reduce the spinning
** pointing the camera with an angle of 1.5 degree
the sun is about 0.5 degree, the size of a finger nail
attitude determination, the orientiation of the satellite wrt to earth
measure the magnetic field and the angle to the sun with sun sensors
wahba's problem solved by singular value decomposition
when sun is not visible, use EKF to predict the orientation
** controlling the attitude
micropropulsion thrusters
reaction wheels
** athenoxat
five imaging payloads
fish eye camera
wide angle camera (300m resolution)
night vision (25m)
determine the resolution by comparing against detailed maps
** space is changing
moving towards micro satellites
smaller satellites and higher resolutions
** launch cost
for a 3U satellite, 200-300K
