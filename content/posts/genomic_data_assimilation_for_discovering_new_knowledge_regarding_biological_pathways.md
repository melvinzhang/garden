{"title": "Genomic Data Assimilation for Discovering New Knowledge Regarding Biological Pathways", "tags": ["talk"]}
CREATED: 200809290400
Speaker: Rui Yamaguchi
 * Types of networks: signalling networks, gene regulatory networks, metabolic networks
 * Integrate biological models and biological data to discover new knowledge
 * Data assimilation is statistical framwork to integrate simulation model and data
 * Formulated as a non-linear state space model
 * For sparse data, model tend to overfit, hence need to have trade-off between goodness of fit and penalty for parameter estimation
 * Results on EGFR pathway
