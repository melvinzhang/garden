Dec 15: "The game is not designed to teach. The intention is to provide an “instrument” that, in addition to being fun to play, not only provides implicit learning but may also be used as a basis for formal learning in a scholastic setting. We learned all of these design lessons from the piano." Tag: @[598590613:2048:Janine Teo]

Oct 19: Learning the game of Go from scratch and beating AlphaGo Master in 21 days. Gives new meaning to the phrase "Learn X in 21 days".  Source: https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/

Aug 19: Wasitora, Nekoru Queen and her brood of Cat Dragons against the Rats of Magic: The Gathering. Coming soon in Magarena 1.88, see commit https://github.com/magarena/magarena/commit/55336e481d6281f2ee4ca95e775da257b3ab7f45

Aug 16: Good summary of the claims in Norbert Blum's proposed proof of P ≠ NP and how they overcome existing barriers. Approach is to show that determining whether a graph contains a k-clique requires superpolynomial circuits.

Aug 11: "Nekoru, or Cat-Dragons, are cat-like beings with reptilian wings from Jamuraa." Coming soon to C17. Looking forward to adding them to Magarena.

Jul 12: The stand out anime of this season. A beautiful cinematic feel reminiscent of Studio Ghibli's work with a touch of a darker story beneath the surface.

Jun 27: TIL that RPG Maker XP uses Ruby for game scripting. Had a fun weekend playing "Exile Fate" but got very annoyed at some bugs in the Linux port so delved into the Ruby script and fixed it.

Most annoying issue: party formation resets anytime you add/remove characters, the fixed version remembers the position of party members who were not changed.

May 26: Aja Huang and Fan Hui shares the story of AlphaGo from its birth in 2014 to after the match with Lee Sedol with many amusing anecdotes. For example, AlphaGo improves at a rate of about 1 rank every month, and could probably beat a 9p with 2 stone handicap as of Aug 2016.

Apr 08: TIL the current record for a 5 state 2 symbol Turing machine is 47,176,870 steps before halting. This is not known to be the largest number of steps as there are remains 43 machines whose behavior we do not understand. Ref: http://skelet.ludost.net/bb/nreg.html

Mar 29: "In this talk, University of Alberta researcher Michael Bowling describes a decade long research program to build AI that can cope with the hallmarks of poker — deception, bluffing, and manipulating what other players know.

This research has culminated in two landmark results: Cepheus playing a perfect game of limit poker, and most recently, DeepStack (in a collaboration with Czech researchers) beating poker pros at the game of no-limit poker." via https://twitter.com/DeepStackAI
