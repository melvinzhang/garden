** revamp of Millennium hotel booking system in 12 days
user centric and test driven approach
12 days because of budget constraints
** day 1: mini inception
bring together usually siloed departments
eg. loyalty program manager's concerns were not heard

shared understanding of project vision and goals
high level scope and core processes
identify key risks, issues
establish technical and testing approach

time boxes exercises: open, organize. finalize

vision -> personas -> user journeys, visual design ->
technical approach -> features/stories -> estimate -> release plan

*** create an elevator pitch
for whom?
we do?
so what?

*** develop user persona
goals, pain points, motivations
business traveller
leisure traveller

*** as is user journey
put up the pages on paper and put on the board
pain points as pink post-its
ideas as yellow post-its

*** to be user journey
as post-it notes, start with the high level then drill down into the details

*** competitor analysis

** day 2: collaborative design
concrete details for user journey

high fidelity designs of the pages

** day 3: rapid prototyping
two developers, one designer

selective testing, eg. search box interactions, rest of the page is static image

** day 4: popup design studio
gave coffee and biscuits but found that visitors are interested to give their opinion
survey to get information about the user
interactive testing and paper prototypes

setup at grand copthorn hotel, 1-5pm
grab visitors to review the design
conduct retrospectives with the entire team
* review positive, negatives, comments
* show distance from airport in km
* time to visit nearby attractions
* wifi is free/chargeable, available in room or common area
make changes to the site

** day 5: popup design studio
at studio m, mostly staycation
up sell during the checkout, previous design based on shopping cart which
requires user to add items they want

** day 10: usability testing
much more detailed compared to popup design studio

** day 12: showcase
