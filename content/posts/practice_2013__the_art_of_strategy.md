** static vs dynamic
strategy games are dynamic
other games are story/content driven, fixed progression (static)
** board games are transparent
** strategy games have interesting decisions
between solution (obvious or clear path to solve a problem) and
guess (player have no good way to decided between the options)
** game should be efficient, not waste player's time
** boiling down to the core mechanic
Mario - jumping
efficient design
** non essential elements of games
*** tons of content
*** labour
money in monopoly - breaking bills feels like work
*** spectacle
fancy effects, graphics
