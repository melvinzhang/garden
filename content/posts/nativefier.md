** Demo of Nativefier
started with WhatsApp Web
** uses electron, nodejs, es6
generates icons of app and other information needed by Electron packager
** uses commander.js for cli
** cross platform testing
** workaround to behave like a browser
add menu items
** marketing
posted on hackernews previously but not much traction as cli was complex
improved cli by eliminating options by auto detecting and posted again and got put on front page
