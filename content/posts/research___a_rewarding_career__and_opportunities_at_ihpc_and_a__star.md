I: CS? I: Computer Scientist, I: Computational Scientist

Q: Why R&D is important?
A: R&D -> New products, new processes, new knowledge

Q: Is R&D too niche?
A: Training the mind to ask the right question, think critically, be creative, generate ideas, conceptualize, explore, analyze. Marketable skills that you will need in a knowledge-driven economy.
