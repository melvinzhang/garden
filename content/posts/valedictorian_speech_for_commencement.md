Valedictorian Speech for Commencement ceremony on 12th July 2006 10:00am

Mr. Pro-Chancellor, Mr. President,

Distinguished Guests, Fellow Graduates,

Ladies and Gentlemen.

Good morning.

# Introduction
It is a great honor and privilege to give this speech on behalf of my fellow
graduates and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the
graduates on this momentous occasion.

For most of us, this ceremony marks our entry into the harsh realities of the
working world. The IT industry has seen tremendous change in the last few years.
When we first entered the university in 2002, the industry was still reeling
from the dot com bust and the economic downturn in 2001. This coupled with the
local push for the life sciences as the new wave of the economy led to a feeling
that the IT industry was in the doldrums. Fortunately for us, just as we were
about to graduate, signs of a strong recovery are in sight with the formulation
of the Intelligent Nation 2015 national IT master plan and the initiatives from
the government to develop the local digital media industry. Another unique
aspect of this industry is the relatively low barriers to entry due to the
proliferation of private informatics schools, certification programs and online
courses. This has led to an industry which is faced with professionals with a
wide variety of abilities and competencies. Today, in the face of rapid changes
and a competitive job market, a prime concern for graduates is perhaps how to
distinguish ourselves from other professionals in this industry?

I would like to suggest three important characteristics of our graduates which
we should leverage upon. These are a strong grounding in the fundamentals of
Computing; the ability to integrate computing with other disciplines and having
both soft skills as well as technical skills.

# Training vs Education
A common complain among Computing students is the lack of training on specific
technologies or tools that are currently used in the industry. Alt hough being
well versed in certain programming languages or computer systems provide short
term benefits such as allowing graduates to get off to a quick start, these
technologies tend to be transient due to the short life cycle of technology. In
contrast, having a firm understanding of the underlying computer science
concepts provides the underpinnings which enables one to quickly pick up or even
to create the new generation technologies. It is this independence in learning
and applying new knowledge that will be crucial to a successful career in
computing.

# Beyond Computing
Besides being competent in computing, as graduates of integrated programs, we
are also familiar with how Computing can be combined with other disciplines such
as business, arts, engineering and science. This gives us a broad perspective
of how Computing can provide solutions to problems in different domains.
Therefore as graduates, we should look beyond becoming software developers or
IT managers. Graduates should also think about taking non-IT jobs and then look
at how they can use IT to create value for the business.

# Soft Skills
However competency in technical skills is only part of what makes a SoC
graduate. The ability to communicate ideas and work in teams are some example
of soft skills that are important for career development. Group projects and
class presentations gives us a chance to develop these skills while we are
still in the university, while participating in extra curricular activities help
us to develop better leadership and interpersonal skills.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, as graduates we should be leverage upon the strengths of the
education we have received to distinguish ourselves from others in this field.
However we should not rest upon the laurels of our success but remember that the
degree we have just received is but the key which opens the door of
opportunities. It is how we choose to make use of these opportunities to
continue to learn and adapt that will decide our future success. Once again I
would like to congratulate all graduates and wish you all the best in your
future endeavors.
