Eat lots of lean meats, fresh fruits, and vegetables.

The Paleo Diet: 19-35 protein, 22-40 carbs, 28-47 fat

Saturated fats: mostly bad (meats and whole dairy products)

Monounsaturated fats: olive oil, nuts, and avocados

Polyunsaturated fats: mixed bag, omega 3 (fish oils) are healthy, omega 6 (vegetable oils, baked goods, snack food) are not good when out of balance with the omega 3

Glycemic load = Glycemic index * Carbohydrate content

Potassium-Sodium balance

Acid-Base balance

Walnuts (4.2) and Macadamia nuts (6.3) have a favorable omega 6 to omega 3 ratio

Perilla oil (0.27)

Flaxseed oil (0.24) > canola oil (2.0) > mustard seed oil (2.6) > Walnut oil (5.1) > Olive oil (13)

Bad: peanut oil, soybean oil, wheat germ oil
