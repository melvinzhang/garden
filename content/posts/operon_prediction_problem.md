find local maxima and map back to GTT

how are gene cluster from MA exp verified?

scoring using strongest partner

revisit scoring using pathways for hgmm

microarray data â€” co-regulated (up/down) Kendall tau as alternative scoring of gene teams

formulate as dense subgraph problem

run data, minus the genes without expr-data

revisit the graph (with this data, and original data)
