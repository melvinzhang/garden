** Motivation
 * recombination
 * affects accuracy of phylogenetic relationship
 * recombination of biological significance

** Challenges
 * strength of recombination (amount of mutation)
 * timeline
 * mutation rates

** Approaches
 * Global reference tree
 * Sliding window approach
 ** compare sequence on left and right side of window to detect significant difference
 ** base on phylogeny: PDM, Pruned PDM, RECOMP
 ** base on computing distance: PhyPro, DSS

** Weakness of distance based approaches
 * uses hamming distance/edit distance which is not informative, does not take into account distribution of the mutations
 * sensitive to choice of window length

** Contributions
 * concept of shared (k,m) mers as an informatice distance measure
 * positive specific weights, heavier wights near bp, lower weights away from bp
 * scoring function considers chains of shared (k,m) mers

** Experiments
 * three simulated datasets from Pruned PDM paper
 * HepB dataset, compare with bp in literature
 * finding CRF of HIV-1
