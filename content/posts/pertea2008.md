Extends [[Ermolaeva2001]]

Includes more genomes

Improved formula for calculating probability

Eliminate adjacency requirement, threshold to determine maximum number of
genes that are allowed to separate genes in any conserved gene pair

Eliminate the 200bp minimum separation between genes, which works well for E.
Coli, but other species have different distribution of intergenic lengths.

Uses HomologyTeam from He2005
