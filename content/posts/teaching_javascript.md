# Motivating examples
* A,C,E, Ace Card trick
* Guess number game 1 (4 digit, decreasing - increasing, sum is a multiple of nine)
* Guess number game 2 (five tables and binary)
* Guess number game 1.5 (same as before, but iterate until a fixpoint)

# Competitive Programming
* NOI, IOI, ACM/ICPC, TopCoder, Google Code Jam, CodeCrunch
* Benefits: Scholarship, good job prospects

# Online Resources
* USACO, Spanish judge, SPOJ
* CodeCrunch

# What is programming?
program = data structures + algorithm

The first algorithm does not have to be the best. Think of problem solving as a
series of iterative improvements.

Computer programming as manipulating information in memory (analogous to boxes)

Physical demonstration of the technique of swapping two variables with the use of a
temporary variables.

# Lab
* students learn JavaScript from [http://www.w3schools.com/js|W3 Schools] by
themselves
* solve some programming tasks
* register for CodeCrunch account and try to submit a task
