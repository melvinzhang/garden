(connnected) Hub number is the size of the smallest (connected) hub set.

Hub set is similar to dominating set.

Split graph, V = C \cup I where C is a clique and I is an independent set.

Dominating set is NP-complete on split graph.

There exist a minimum dominating set D such that D \subseq C. For split graph,
dominating set equivalent to connected dominating set. This the hub set and
connected hub set is NP-complete on split graph and chordal graph.

Present polynomial algorithms for the following classes of graphs.

Graphs of treewidth at most k. Tree decomposition of a graph, nice tree
decomposition.

Interval graph. Connected hub set forms a path, can be found in linear time.

Permutation graph.

Co-graph (P_4-free graph).
