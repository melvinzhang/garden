** Body segment parameters
 * center of mass
 * mass
 * moment of inertia

** Regression equations
 * based on cadaver studies
 * assume girth is elliptical

** Image based techniques
 * X-ray, CT scan
 * calculate mass along each pixel
 * DEXA - duel energy X-ray densitometry
 ** high radiation, limited avilability of machines

** Image based regression
 * feature based image warping to predict DEXA image of new subject
