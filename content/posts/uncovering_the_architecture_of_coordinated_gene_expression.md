{"title": "Uncovering the architecture of coordinated gene expression", "tags": ["talk"]}
CREATED: 200810300303
Speaker: Rohan Williams, John Curtin School of Medical Research, Australian National University
** Motivation
 * coordinated gene expression
 * co-control, co-regulation, co-expression, co-functionality
 * gene set approach: find motifs enriched in groups of genes of interest
 * shared control approach (this talk)
** Coordinated gene expression from Shared Control
 * measure shared control using jaccard co-efficient
 * hierarchical clustering based on complete-linkage: 2577 clusters, 2478 non-singletons
 * measure of cluster stability using method of Hennig, CSDA 2005
 * cluster properties: #genes, tissue specificity, #chromosomes, functional enrichment (P < 0.05)
** Regulatory variation in gene expression
 * mapped to quantitative trait loci
 * correlation of genetic variation (measure by markers) and gene expression variation
 * cis-acting variant (local), trans-acting variant (distinct)
 * recent human eQTL studies suggests that cis-variants are far more detectable than trans-variants
