Speaker: Patricia Wittkopp
 * cis vs trans regulation, inter vs intra species sites
 ** cis regulation (binding site): allele specific
 ** trans regulation (transcription factor): affects both alleles
 * distinguishing cis vs trans regulatory changes using F1 heterozygous and pyrosequencing to determine #transcripts from each allele
 * contribution of cis/trans between D. Melanogaster and D. Simulans
 ** interspecies more cis regulatory difference
 ** use 2 inter comparisons to derive intraspecies difference
 * Model of neutral evolution doesn't explain the difference
 * Hypothesis 1
 ** trans regulatory maintained by mutation-selection balance
 ** mutational target is larger in trans
 * Hypothesis 2
 ** cis regulatory are fixed preferentially
 ** positive selection for cis or negative selection against trans
 * Properties of regulatory changes (mutation) based on yeast cells using FAS (Florescent assistant sorting)
