Title: An integrative modular approach to systemically predict gene-phenotype associations

** Challenges in microarray expression
 * normalization
 * multiple platforms
 * outliers

** Network based integration
 * co-expression network per microarray
 * find recurrent dense subgraphs in multiple co-expression graphs
 * want co-expression clusters that are enriched for specific functions/conditions
 * map dataset to phenotype term using unified medical language

** Algorithm
 * based on simulated annealing to find subset of vertices that are
 * large
 * dense
 * phenotype specific (hypergeometric p-value)

Use overrepresentation of GO terms to validate gene sets = power of gene sets
for annotation
