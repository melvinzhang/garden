Output of BLAST are HSP (high scoring pairs), pairs of regions from query to
target.

Suppose query is a gene, want to group target HSP into genes. Difficulty due
to multiple paralogous genes.

Cui2007 group HSP based on distance. Assume HSP in same gene are nearer than
HSP between two genes, not true for paralogous genes in tandem cluster.  Use
of ad-hoc distance threshold to separate adjacent genes.

Approach is to model HSP in a DAG and partition HSP by computing shortest
path in DAG. Makes use of novel length metric in the DAG. Similar to problem
of determining optimal storage of steel beams.
