# Preparation
Each case is different. What is the most appropriate medium?

"A whole new mind" by Daniel Pink

Design not only function

Story not only argument

Symphony not only focus

Empathy not only logic

Play not only seriousness

Meaning not only accumulation

Make slides that reinforce your words, not repeat them.

"If you want to write" by Brenda Ueland

Constraints and limitations are a powerful ally. Create your own ones, for example see Pecha-Kucha

Simplicity, Clarity and Brevity

Planning analog to see the big picture and your core message.

Computers: bike or car?

Storyboarding

Two questions that matters: 1) What's my point? 2) Why does it matter?

Three parts of a presentations: 1) Slides the audience see 2) Notes only you see 3) Handouts to be taken away

"Made to stick" by Chip Heath and Dan Heath
The Curse of Knowledge results in the speaker speaking in abstractions which makes perfect sense to him alone.

Simplicity
Unexpectedness
Concreteness
Credibility
Emotions
Stories

The Process:
Brainstorming
Grouping and identifying the core
Storyboarding
Creating the slides

# Design
Kanso (Simplicity), Shizen (Naturalness), Shibumi (Elegance)

Less is more. Amplification through Simplification.

Signal vs Noise ratio

Visual clutter.

Give focus to what matters.

Picture Superiority Effect. Make pictures blend into the slide by using images that "bleed" off the edge, filling the entire screen.

Text within images. The image should have plenty of empty space.

Use of empty spaces.

Directing the eye with images.

Balance. Symmetrical designs are more static than asymmetrical designs and evoke feelings of formality or stability. Good presentatations have a mix of slides that are symmetrical and asymmetrical.

Grids and the rule of thirds.

The big four
Contrast: strong and clear focal point
Repetition: reusing of the same or similar elements throught your design
Alignment: every element is connected visually via an invisible line
Proximity: related items should be grouped together

# Delivery
The art of being completely present.

Learning from the Art of Judo

1) Carefully observe oneself and one's situation, carefully observe others and carefully observe one's environment

2) Seize the initiative in whatever you undertake

3) Consider fully, act decisively

4) Known when to stop

5) Keep to the middle

Passion, risk and "Playing on One Buttock"

Don't take yourself so seriously.

Hara Hachi Bu, eat until 80 percent full

Leave them just a little hungry for more.

Removing barriers to communication. Don't hide behind a lectern. Use a wireless
mic and remove control for advancing the slides. Keep the lights on.
