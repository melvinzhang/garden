{"title": "LaTeX", "tags": []}

Prior to this was using MS Word which makes it hard to understand the underlying structure of the doc as it is a WYSIWYG editor.

LaTeX file is a plain text file, markup for formatting is clearly visible in
file. Requires a separate step to produce the output PDF. Forces the writer to
focus on structuring the document and leaves the typesetting to the system.

Especially useful for technical writing with lots of mathematical equations.

Pandoc can convert markdown to LaTeX and then PDF.
