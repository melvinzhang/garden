{"title": "Session 44: Training vs Exercise", "tags": []}

* Training is for everyone, not just athletes
* Training is with some goal in mind, each session should be closer to the goal
* Exercise is for the immediate needs, training is for long term
* Training is structured, exercise is usually ad-hoc
* Exercise is good, training is better
* Not as hard as you think, can be very simple
