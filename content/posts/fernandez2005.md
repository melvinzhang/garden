Shows how FTIR can be used for histopathologic recognition

FTIR permits high-throughput and spatially resolved measurements but lack
sensitivity for complex determinations (ref 14) and are limited to detecting
either significant biochemical changes (ref 15) or foreign inclusions (ref 16)

Use of FTIR typically involves the following steps
# measurement of large numbers of spectral profiles from every tissue subtype
# identification of relevant spectral markers
# organization of markers into a prediction algorithm
# statistical validation of the automated process

Histologic classes contain identical chemical compoenents, their
characteristic spectra are similar but reveal small differences in specific
absorbance features. Univariate analyses are unable to distinguish all
histologic constituents.

Subtle molecular structural changes are indicated by peak shifts, band shapes
and relative intensity changes. Example of spectral features: ratio of
absorbance at 1080cm^-1 (phosphodiester) to 1545cm^-1 (amide II) provides a
definitive metric for discriminating epithelial cells from stromal cells.

Relate a small set of hand crafted spectral metrics (with physical
significance to tissue biochemistry) to specific histologic entities.
Different from typical practice where large spectral regions are reduced to
smaller sets of variables  by mathematical means. Set of 18 metrics provided
accurate segmentation.
