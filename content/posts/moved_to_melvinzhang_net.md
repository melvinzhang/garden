WordPress was a decent blogging solution but it has become a bit too bloated
for my tastes. It also does not support custom domains without a yearly fee.
The cost of domain mapping is ridiculous ($9.97/year) compared to the price
of owning a domain ($6.99/year for a .net domain from www.internetbs.net).

Posterous turned on its WordPress import feature today and with that my
migration is complete.

This site will no longer be updated. New posts will appear on https://melvinzhang.net.
