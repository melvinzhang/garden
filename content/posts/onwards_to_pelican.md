Octopress itself seems to have stagnated (just like this blog), the last update was in 2015.

Most of my programming these days is in Python, so I'd figured it would be fun to try out a Python static generator.

The most popular one is [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) and it is now powering this site. The theme is [Elegant](https://elegant.oncrashreboot.com/).

Most of the posts from Posterous days was in HTML, so I took this opportunity to migrate them to Markdown.
