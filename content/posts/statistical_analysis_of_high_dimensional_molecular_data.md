** Multivariate statistical procedures
 * Cluster analysis
 * PCA, ICA
 * Factor analysis
 * Latent variable analysis
 * main objective is to reduce dimensionality in a meaningful way
** Cluster Analysis
 * ubiquitous in microarray studies
 * not much supporting statistical theory
** PCA
 * dimension reduction by optimizing variance explanation
 * ordination
 * with noisy data, principle components may reflect stochastic effects and environmental noise
** Latent variable model
 * relates a set of observed or manifest variables to a set of unobserved or latent variables
 * latent variables often reflect phenomenon of interest
 * separates variability that is shared (commonality) or unique
 * latent variables by factor analysis
 * exploratory factor analysis: detect natural groupings of variables (factors) based on shared variability
 * e.g. Latent structure of AA physiochemical variation (Atchley2005, PNAS)
** Utility of Factor Scores
 * each amino acid can be represented by factor scores for each latent variable, summarizes almost 500 physiochemical attributes
 * new way of aligning protein sequences base on factor scores
 * factor scores as data in discriminant analysis (Atchley2006)
