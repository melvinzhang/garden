Measuring cognitive performance

Robots cannot be programmed for all possible situations, they need to be able
to learn!

Statistical learning procedures need many training examples.

Learning from interaction: master and apprentice, learning as a social
activity (a kind of communication)

Robocup tournament in Singapore: to teach a robot to pickup an item from a
shop and bring it to the checkout

Interacting with robots
* subjects must not be computer scientists or familiar with robots
* feedback is very important
* emotions is crucial in human interactions
* feedback by emotion mimicry

Acoustic packaging: speech + motion segmentation

Social robotics
* getting humans to "believe" that the robots are more than they seem
* learning from interaction with humans
