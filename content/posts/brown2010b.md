Title: New decoding algorithms for HMM using distance measures on labellings

Using HMM for approximately identifying boundaries of features in a seq

Traditional HMM decoding algorithms does not optimize the boundaries directly

Find a labelling, l, that maximizes prob of ball of labellings around l

DP algorithm for computing probability of a ball + local search to find the best
ball
