** Promoter identification in Prokaryote Genomic Context
 * high no of false positives in current tools
 * motivation => reduce false positives, narrow signal detection
 * use pHMM and ANN

** Genefinder with predicted exon taxonomy
 * common inaccurate patterns in existing gene finder
 ** identified 13 types of exon classification
 * only 4 exon tpyes, single, initial, internal, terminal
 * exons also exist in untranslated regions
