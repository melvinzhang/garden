** The future so far
software substituting for mechanism
software is free to copy, physical mechanism is expensive to copy
physical buttons become virtual touch buttons
reduce cost and complexity of circuits
palm pilot enabled p2p decentralized communication
data are no longer in the computers, the computers are in the data
WIMP -> digital literacy
** The next mountain
*** device fungibilty
build markets
empower users
*** information liquidity
ability to flow freely to where it is needed
packets == shipping containers
no standard container at higher level
*** cyberspace of digital objects
uuid for digital objects
URL (location) != id of a place
** Platform and UI
*** yesterday
platform is hardware for applications (data silos)
*** today
browser is platform, text oritented, server -> client
*** tomorrow
information centric instead of app centric
composibility of apps
** Tyranny of the orthodoxy
increased flakiness, frustration of computerize products
complexity cliff
corporate clouds, services come and go
no software engineering standard, "anyone can play"
sofware closer to literature than manufacturing
** How does Nature does it
internet of plants, p2p, redundancy
beutiful complexity
 * hierarchy
 * modularity
 * redundancy
 * generativity
** How design does it
humanized information, VCR 12:00
draw what you mean
things (engineering) -- design -- people (social)
** Design science
objective design principles to be discovered
interaction "physics" - consistency
user experience is emergent property of all products
command centric -> application centric -> document centric -> information centric
wizard-of-oz prototyping, IoT tweets via sticky notes
*** physical contenxt
 * place, region
 * floor, room
 * topological
*** device context
 * service discovery
 * p2p
 * code/app device awareness
*** information context
 * data flow from device to device
 * replication
 * what are the info objects, which device contain them
** Architecture
as organic principle
as model
as style
information architecture
eg structure of a book: chapter, index, etc
** Life in an information ecology
*** life forms (devices)
 * process information
 * information arch, device arch
 * environment is human culture
*** resilency
 redundancy
 diversity
 stochasic processes
*** publisher vouching for author
aggreator of trust
*** pyramid
few dev -- several scripters -- many user
each level empowers the next
** Aspects of tomorrow
local data, peer 2 peer
smaller, simpler hardware components
devices will be cheaper
information commons, uuid
publishing as signing
** Epilogue
cheap, simple, devices
microtransactions
information visualization
