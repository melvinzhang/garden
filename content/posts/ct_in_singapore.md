{"title": "CT in Singapore", "tags": ["talk"]}
speaker: Chee-Kit Looi
event: 15th IOI conference

Code for Fun - 10 hours in upper primary compulsory

visual-based programming, robotic kits and/or microcontrollers

2 types of CT by Miles Berry
* applying approaches the CS to problems in other disciplines
* finding automatable solution to problems

Computational thinking -> action, creating apps

Analysis of Apple's Swift Accelerator Programme, positive in getting students ready

Pre/post test on unplugged binary number activity
* unplugged activity -> algorithm -> code
* evidence shows it does work

Reflections
* CT for all vs (deep) CT for some
  * do both!
* CT education vs CS education
  * thinking processes before and after coding
* CT is general vs CT is unique
  * some overlap with other subjects
  * uniqueness: finding automatable solution
