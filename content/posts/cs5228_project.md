** Clustering without similarity measure
 * distance function difficult to apply to categorical data
 * distance function is proxy, really want to find consistent groups but similarity is only pairwise, hence need properties of metric
 * notation of a consistent group? information theory? See paper "Clustering without a Metric"

** Outlier detection without clustering
 * is notion of distance necessary

** Data mining in structured data
 * KEG database of pathways
 * Structured data
 ** tuples (nominal, ordinal, interval)
 ** set
 ** sequence (document as sequences)
 ** tree
 ** graph

** Mining changes to data (Temporal mining)
 * evolution of sequences, eg gene order
 * evolution of graphs, eg social network

** Mining KDD Cup
