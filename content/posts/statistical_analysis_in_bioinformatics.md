** Functional study of genes
 * comparative genomics (cross species/group comparison)
 ** homolog search
 ** phylogenetic tree - evolution of species, diseases development
 * mutation
 ** induction
 ** knock-out
 ** knock-down
 ** deduce the model, statistical inference
 * mRNA (gene expression)
 ** sequence a part of the gene
 ** hybridization
 *** How to get unique expression intensity from multple prob intensities?
 *** Gene ranking, is t-statistic or ANNOVA a good method?
 *** What are the genes involved in a certain pathway?

** Proteomics
 * at least 0.5 million proteins
 * rules less clear
 * data variations larger

** Live-cell bioimaging
 * SNR is smaller
 * cells are movable

** Statistical learning to find biomarkers
 * cross validation != robustness or statistical significance
 * data are with measurement errors
 * probability of measurements errors are:
 ** tail heavy
 ** asymmetric
