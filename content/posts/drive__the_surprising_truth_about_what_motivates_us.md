Threats and rewards only work for repetitive mechanical tasks.

The three essentials for motivation when doing non-repetitive work are
autonomy, mastery, and purpose (AMP).

To achieve flow, you need:
 * clear goals
 * immediate feedback
 * a challenge that is not too easy, not too difficult
 * autonomy
 * something that engages you
 * enough structure
