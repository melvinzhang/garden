Facts about protein foldin
* needs to assumed a defined 3D structure
* randomly peptide chains do not fold, ~ 1 in $10^{10}$
* RNA (both as templates and active agent) preceded proteins
* relatively few stable structures
* most proteins preserve their structure but not their sequence

Main hypothesis
* decomposition of proteins into main supersecondary structures
* folded proteins evolved by fusion and recombination from an ancestral set of peptides, which emerged in the context of RNA-dependent replication and catalysis
* analogous to the way words evolve in languages
* functional drift

Goal
* identify library of supersecondary structures
* how complex structures evolved

Recognizing remote homology
* HHsearch makes use of HMM incorporating both the sequence and secondary structure information
