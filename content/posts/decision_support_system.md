# Why DSS?
Decision making is complex.

Computers allows one to process large amounts of information,
but cannot do problem solving.

DSS provides information and tools to help in decision making.

# Components of DSS
Data  & raw facts
Model & simplified representation of the real world (logical, mathematical and statistical)
UI    & how the decision maker interacts with the DSS


# Types of DSS
* Data-driven
* Model-driven
* Spreadsheet-based (pivot table in excel)
* Web-based
* GIS
* Consumer DSS (comparison shopping)
* Organizational DSS

# Supply chain management via MIT Beer Game
