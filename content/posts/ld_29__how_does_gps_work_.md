* started with Sputnik, scientists at MIT noticed doppler effect of signals from the russian satellite
* possible to track the satellite from the ground, conversely if we know the position of the satellite we can track the receiver
* started out for tracking submarines carrying nuclear missles
* allowed for commericial use in 1983, following Korean Air Line Flight 007
* GNSS of which GPS refers to the USA system, there is also GLONASS, Beidou
* basic idea of determining location from distance to satellites
  * accuracy of 5m
* originally limited to 100m accuracy for civilian use (selected availability)
* differential GNSS
  * less than 1m
* disabled in 2000 due to use of DGNSS
* problems with GPS
  * no signal in tunnels
  * canyon effect
  * noise due to atmospheric conditions
* combine GPS with other sensors
  * available wifi signals
  * available mobile network signals
  * accelerometer
* post processing
