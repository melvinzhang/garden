Applications of sensor networks

Need for long-term operations $\imply$ efficient power management

Use of energy: computation, communication (uses most energy), sensing

Receiver-side energy (idle listening) dominates the power consumption

Concept of low-duty-cycle network: nodes listen briefly and shutdown their radios most of the time (95% or more). A wakeup schedule must be shared by neighbouring nodes.
Sleep latency: amount of time sender must wait for receiver to wake up
