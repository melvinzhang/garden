Dec 24: Manage to double the performance with a small change! Originally this code used manual reference counting and it took 7+s on one benchmark. Later I changed it to shared_ptr to take advantage of the C++11 library but that increase the running time to 20+s. Switching to a different reference counting library based on intrusive pointers didn't help. What worked is to delay recursively updating the counts when a cell becomes garbage and wait until the cell is reused. Reduced the running time to 9+s.

Nov 12: My split mechanical keyboard from www.smartyao.com is here. Found out I've been hitting some keys with the wrong hand all these while.

Oct 21: Catch Dr Strange at the first SoC movie outing on 5th Nov. $5 for SoC students/staff/alumni, $8 for guests. Starts with an afternoon tea at 3pm followed by the movie.

Sep 26: Flamegraphs don't work so well for recursive functions like minimax, which generate stack traces of different lengths. This leads to the tower of functions seen on the top plot. I fixed this by collapsing the recursive function calls in the bottom plot which make it clearer what each recursive call is doing.

Sep 25: Generated a flamegraph for AI vs AI match in Magarena using honest-profiler and hprof2flamegraph. Also learned about the "safepoint sample bias" problem of common Java profilers and how honest-profiler avoids it.

May 29: Incidentally, earlier this year I demoed a Turing Machine emulator to commemorate the 80th anniversay, see https://engineers.sg/video/building-a-turing-machine-emulator-to-explore-turing-s-great-ideas-nus-hackers--674

Apr 14: Every wondered why Alan Turing is known as the father of computer science and the highest award known as the Turing Award? A key contribution is his seminal work in defining computation and developing the concept of a universal machine. For this week's Friday Hacks, I'll be sharing about a Turing machine emulator I developed and what we can learn from Turing's ideas.

Apr 10: TIL how to use ANSI escape codes to create animations on the command line. The recording shows my Turing Machine emulator running Turing's second machine that generates the infinite sequence 0010110111011110...

Mar 26: A panel discussion on Godel's Incompleteness results and its implications. It is refreshing to hear the panelists (Gregory Chaitin, Mario Livio, Marvin Minsky, Rebecca Newberger Goldstein) vigorously arguing their points.

Mar 13: Solving Gregory Chaitin's "Exploring Randomness" chapter 3, exercise 7, https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~chaitin/ait3.html

Ex 7: The software for this chapter uses an experimental new primitive function was-read to speed up the program prefix Î³. I'm not satisfied with this---invent a better solution!

Sol:
```
delta (length 1176) proves that H(x,y) <= H(x) + H(y|x) + 1176

define delta
  let x* read-exp           [get sexp of x*]
  let y* read-exp           [get sexp of y*]
  let x  eval x*            [calculate x from x*]
  let y  (y* bits x*)       [calculate y from y* and bits of x*]
  cons x cons y nil
```
Seems a bit too good to be true. Can anyone verify if this solution is a proper one?
