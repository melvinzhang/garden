* Palmaris longus: used by orangutans
* Ear muscles: likely our ancestors could move their ear
* Goose bumps:  not much use as we don't have a lot of hair
* Wisdom teeth: help us to grind plant tissue
* Tail bone (coccyx): our ancestor lives in trees
* Hair: we've lost a lot of it already, some are pretty useful, others less so
