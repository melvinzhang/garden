Title: Heuristics for the inversion median problem

Investigate power of good move heuristic from MGR for inversion median problem.

Good moves can be applied:
 * one at a time or apply all good moves at once (maximal)
 * serially or in parallel

After good moves are exhausted, select remaining genome that minimize the total
distance.

Maximal parallel is the best

Insights: parallel $\gt$ serial, maximal $\gt$ one at a time

Rule of thumb: try to keep original permutation when solving median
