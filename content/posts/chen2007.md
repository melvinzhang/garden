Title: Assessing performane of orthology detection strategies applied to
eukaryotic genomes

From the creators of OrthMCL. Methods compared:
RIO, Orthostrapper (phylogeny)
RSD (distance)
BBH, RBH, Inparanoid, OrthoMCL, KOG (BLASTP)
SBH, BLASTP, TribeMCL (Homology)

Makes use of latent class analysis (LCA), which is based on the assumption
that agreement enhances confidence and disagreement indicates possible errors.

Methods based on phylogeny (RIO, Orthostrapper) or evolutionary distance (RSD)
exhibit low FP (1-7%) but high FN (24-64%). Consersely, using homology methods
(BLASTP, TribeMCL) results in high FP (50-56%) and low FN (4-5%). Between
these two extremes, BLASTP-based orthology prediction methods exhibit a range
of FP and FN rates.  Only OrthoMCL and Inparanoid have FP and FN < 20%
