Defines positional homologs as those that also have homologous neigboring
genes.

They found that positional homologs had on average relatively lower rates of
substitution at the DNA level than duplicate homologs in different genomic
locations, regardless of the level of protein sequence divergence.

Addition of a stringency filter based on the second best hits was an efficient
way to remove dubious ortholog identification in BLAST and FASTA analyses.

Adding a minimum length requirement improved the accuracy of prediction.
Requirement of 70% coverage of the longer protein > 70% converage of the
shorter protein.

The largest score improvement was obtained by putting a strict E-value spread
requirement. E-value spread is defined as the ratio of the best hit and the
next best hit E-values.
