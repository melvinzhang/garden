{"title": "Epigenomics of murine and adipose cells", "tags": ["SIBS", "talk"]}

murine cells, human adipose stromal cells

histone modifications, transcription factors

Relationship between
* chromatin state, histone modification
* mRNA and miRNA expression
* binding sites of transcription factor

Method
* take pre-adipocytes and adipocytes of human and mouse
* map histone modifications over time
* compare maps and identify enriched transcription factor motifs
* validate regulators of adipose
