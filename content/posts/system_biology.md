** Modelling biological processes
 * qualitative
 * quantitative
 ** predict actions of metabolites in a limited scope
 ** using petri net, differential equations
 ** eg. WNT signalling pathway

** Rule based systems
 * Brutlag et al
 * difficult to obtain parameters of DE
 * qualitative can explain conclusion/inference

** Simulation of DNA metabolism
 * polymerase I, nick translation, strand displacement -> template matching
 * only for single ploymerase enzyme
 * limited to pathways without cycles
 * probability of different scenarios not available
