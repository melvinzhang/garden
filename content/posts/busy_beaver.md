BB(n) is the maximum number of 1s printed by a 2-state n-symbol Turing Machine when it halts

BB(n) for n < 5 are known.

BB(5) >= 47,176,870 there are several programs where the halting is unknown. There is a collaborative effort to determine BB(5) https://bbchallenge.org/

BB(n) is larger than any computable function.
