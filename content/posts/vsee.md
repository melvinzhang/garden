PhD work (2003) -- incubation --> 2008 -- CIA investment --> 2010 (Bay area social
network company investment)

Main features: video conferencing, applications sharing, file sharing

Tool for working remotely to solve the morning traffic jam problem

Focus on the enterprise market, where the money is

On startups
* 600k startups per year in US, only 8 become successful

* TechCruch, YC vs Merger and acquisition
  * high publicity does not ensure success, eyeballs alone not enough (few can
  * be like twitter or YouTube), need a business model and a product with
  * value (solve someone's problem)

* Companies in different domains need different amounts of incubation,
* difficult to speed up

* Focus on a niche area where you can add value

* Don't get funding too early (crawl, walk, run). Funding = booster rocket,
* cannot afford to make mistakes

* Focus on the engineering/good usable product, patents not as important.
* Patents are for offense, rarely for defense

* Learn from Lincoln, Pat Tillman, Mother Teresa

On management
* lead by example, never allow the word "boss"

* mirror vs glass: recognize the people for your success, you are responsible
* for the failures

* sandwich method: complement the person, criticize the action, complement the
* person

On sales
* most important untaught skill

* read Zig Ziglar's books

* know people

On improvement
* micro learning, learn three things everyday

* break patterns

* ask your real friends for frank feedback

* importance of quiet time (defense against information overload)
