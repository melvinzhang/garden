Euclid to Turing, the search for truth connects them
infinitely many primes
* Euclid's proof via the Socratic method

Guess a number from 1 to 15
* a binary tree with 15 leaves have depth 4
* left or right down the tree give us the binary code for the number

Reliable communication in the face of errors
* redundancy in the message, repeat each bit 3 times
* how many questions to guess 0 to 15 if the person is allowed to lie once
* Hamming invented a one-error correcting binary code of length 7 with 16 codewords
  * so that the computer can read his punch cards correctly
* no strategy can use fewer than 7 guesses, Hamming's code is optimal

Ada Lovelace insight that computers could do many different things
* Turing proved that there is no algorithm to decide the truth or falsity of a mathematical statement
