A computational approach toward label-free protein quantification using predicted peptide detectability, ISMB 2006
 * [[abstract | http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/22/14/e481]]
 * can be used to measure level of protein
 * increase in level of protein -> more peptides can be detected
 * sort peptides according to detectability
