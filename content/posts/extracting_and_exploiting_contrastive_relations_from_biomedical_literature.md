** Constrast
 * informative units of information
 * explicit difference, implicit similarity
 * most db are only for positive relations
 * eg. Protein A (positive) but not protein B (negative), interacts with Protein C (presupposed protein)
 * name entity recognition
 * grounding - important to biologists
 * textual names -> protein db
 * applications -> refine pathways
