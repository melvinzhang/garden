{"title": "What is the fastest portable method to cool a hot drink?", "tags": ["physics", "everyday", "contrib"]}

Call on 29th Nov: brainstorming on possible topics
I suggested the topic of creating a human powered device (straw creating fine
bubbles) to cool a hot drink. We can then compare this against other methods.

Call on 7th Dec: research plan
finalized the research question, constraints are good
explained about the parts of the research plan
do other things in parallel: get materials, do small scale experiment
proposed setting up a research journal/diary
team requested for a second call in the week, I proposed Friday 10:30 to 11:30

Call on 10th Dec:
are there simulation software?
* not that I know of but I did not do the research.
difference small scale and actual experiment?
* small scale is to get some practical experience, real experiment need to control for many factors
uniformity of temperature at the start may be difficult for anything other than 100 degree celsius
experiments are to get feedback on the device and to figure out how to improve it
need to do several iterations to develop the device
impact beyond a drink?
* look for other applications of cooling liquids

Call on 14th Dec:
use spoon to whip air into the drink
found some simulation software Energy2D and Energy3D
* might take more time to build the model than to do the exp..
at least 2 rounds of exp
* round 1: test out initial ideas and baseline methods
* round 2: improve the best method from round 1

Call on 17th Dec:
come up with hypothesis/questions and experiments to test them
come up with prototypes based on results of first experiments
use the same rate of flow of air for blowing/aeration
measure the room temperature

Conclusion, aeration is one of the most effective. Takes 7mins to cool from 85°C to 55°C.

We can use [Newton's law of cooling]({{< relref "newton_s_law_of_cooling" >}}) to find the coefficient of heat transfer.

24th Feb 2022
Make it to the SSEF final judging. Need to produce video for public, quad chart and presentation for judges

Audio in the video is bad, seems to be a bit too fast and there is a lot of noise.

Perhaps some ideas of why aeration + vertical stirring is the best? It was
mentioned why metal blocks are bad, but it would be more interesting to give
some hypothesis of why the good methods are good.

Slide 2 has very long text, try to shorten and use simpler more direct language.

Remove underline from slide titles.

The position of the slide title is not consistent.

Slide 8 the top white box cuts the text.
