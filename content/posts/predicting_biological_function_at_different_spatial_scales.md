Discovery process: 1) parts lists, 2) connectivity, 3) functionality
across space and time

# Homology in Metazoan genomes
identifying orthologous groups, eggnog.embl.de
categories of orthologs: 1:1, N:N, patchy, insect-specific, vertebrate-specific, homology
protein domains as functional units, evolution of phosphotyrosine signaling machinery
genomic context, conserved neighborhood
correct orthology analysis is crucial!

# Protein networks
STRING server from EMBL, determining groups of orthologous genes
Probabilistic predictions, von Merin (Nucleic Acid Research)
Improvements
* increased resolution
* include other chemicals such as lipids, metabolites, etc
* include spatial and temporal aspects
Chemical-Protein interaction prediction for drug retargetting using shared side effects
Networks in 3D (spatial), SCB Mycoplasma project
Networks in 4D (space + time)

# Entire habitats
Comparative metagenomics
Function prediction, Harrington (PNAS, 2007)
Small families are hard to predict
4 levels of scale: gene/orthologous groups, operon, KEGG, functional classes (GO)
Tools: iTOL and iPath
