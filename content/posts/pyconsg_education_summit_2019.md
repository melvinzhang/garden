{"title": "PyConSG Education summit 2019", "tags": ["talk"]}
25th June 2019 9 - 5pm

** Opening address
speaker: Dr Liew
time for CdEd APAC?
how young should we introduce computational thinking
how to introduce AI in curriculum

** Introduction to Vivita
speaker: Lee Hoi Leong

for P3 and above

"No curriculum, no teacher"
* student lead activities

"The world is programmable. No Limit,"
* you can be the change maker

"Education is a right, not a privilege"
* courses are free to attend

Unlearning learning community meetup
* updating education in SIngapore and beyond

** Professional software development, can it be taught?
speaker: Ivan Zimine

hard to grow and maintain software

spec/design first

professional = responsible for outcome

software borrows terms from construction
construction is limited by gravity

complexity = "software gravity"

how to handle complexity
* invest in communication and social skills
* invest in simple tools and pragmatic development practices

Programs are written for people to read, SICP
* proper naming
  * use intention revealing names
  * avoid disinformation
  * use pronouceable names

Example: refactored fizzbuzz
* is_divisible_by
* early return

Linguistics is more important for programming than math
* how to get feedback on code readability?

Specification
* executable specification
  * cucumber
* specification by example
* communication with the stake holders to build the right product

Pair programming

Tools
* plain text
* command line
* text editor

Test driven development
* test, code, refactor
* a design tool
* tests as specification
* keep code tight, just to solve the test

Can it be taught?
* The pragmatic programmer
* sofware craftsmanship singapore

** Transferring python skills for game-based learning environments to real-world environment
speaker: Chris Boesch

Journey of a Sec 2 student Yan
* low barrier for participation
  * solve 1 level
* choice of different activities

Game based via Code combat
* clear goals
* hints
* feedback

Real world problems via Jupter notebook
* provides scaffolding
* not too much text
* dealing with Python errors
* Google colab
  * create your own activity
  * share with other students

Towards real-world problems
* NLP to analyze feedback questions
* identify drawn numbers
* play pictionary
  * draw something until the AI recognizes it

Multiplayer levels in code combat
* finals is done in pair-programming in 2 hours

** Solving operational challenges while teaching
speaker: Lawrence Putra

Mentoring a group of 3 from Techladies

Challenge is to make the sorting process for IAmTalented and CollaborateSG more efficient

Breaking down the challenge into steps
* learing how to manipulate excel in code
* read execl in code
* various data types in excel
* how to find the answer yourself

** Developing students' computational thinking through interest driven activities
speaker:

Integrate mathematics and computing
* Poly's four steps

** Google colab and Kaggle for data science/AI education
speaker: Chen Weiqiang

colab = hosted Jupter notebook
share with others

use it to create tutorials

modelling market share of taxi using recurrence relations
* part of further mathematics

use sliders to change the parameters dynamically and update the plot

AI for students by AI Singapore
