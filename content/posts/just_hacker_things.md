** red teaming
social engineering and physical compromise
bank in beirut

hard to get caught, typically on the last day deliberately allow the employees to catch you
end it on a win for the client
** blue teaming
how quickly can you detect an intruder in your network?

create a domain admin account with domain_adm_tmp and password in the notes and
login hours = 0, when an attacker tries to login and alert will be sent out

create a 1x1 pixel with a link, only an attack bot will click on it

check the user agent string for attackers, most are using OTS attack software
** train employees on their security responsibilities
