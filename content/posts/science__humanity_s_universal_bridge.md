seven sisters have been observed by all of humanity

** predicting the motion of the planets
Copernicus's idea of helio centric system was validated by Galileo's observation with telescopes
the beginning of the scientific method, expanded by Newton
** Einstein's theory of general relativity
impossible to distinguish between gravity and acceleration
validated by observation of gravity lensing effect
** What is reality?
a set of ideas which predict the observations we make
** Science has increased human life expectancy
at a price due to increase in human population
** Science should focus on long term problems
increasing GDP per capita reduces fertility rate,
ensures global population growth stabalises
** Science is a global effort
culture of sharing, international collaboration
but it can only be a bridge
** Science is integral to our future
all movies about the future are science fiction
