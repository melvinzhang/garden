Public key crypto for kids

partition vertices of a graph, each partition is covered by one vertex. Call these the secret vertices.

secret is sum of values on vertices

encoding is to replace value of each vertex with sum of itself and neighbours

decoding is to sum up values of the secret vertices.

problem is the original value of each vertex can be solved as a system of linear equations

fix is to send only n-1 values, leave out the value for one of the non-secret vertices.
