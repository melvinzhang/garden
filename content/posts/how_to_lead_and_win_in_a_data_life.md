people/leadership > tools/tech

leadership is getting people to want to do what you want them to do

leadership is influence, not the number of people reporting to you

humility and discipline

what the team needs to know to operate independently?
* what is the goal?
* why is it important?
* what is my individual contribution to the goal?
* what are the constraints?

managing expectations: what is easy to think about is not correlated with easy to build
