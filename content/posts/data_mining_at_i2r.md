 * Algorithms -- Data -- Applications
** Kids Cancer Heroes
 * Biological data: sequences (DNA),
 * Goals: better drug/treatment, save time/cost, better science
 * Emerging patterns (contrasting): observed in most members of one class but found in none/few of the other classes
 * ALL, heterogeneous cancer, > 12 subtypes
 * Diagnosis requires, 3 different tests and 4 different experts, not feasible in poorer countries
 * PCL: prediction by collective likelihood of emerging patterns, accurate and easily comprehensible
** Fishing for the baby whales
 * Observation: no man is an island
 * Real world networks
 ** large scale, continual growth
 ** distributed, organic growth
 ** abstract notions of distance
 ** scale-free: grow by added new node with m edges to existing nodes, preferential attachment (Science, 1999)
 ** small world, social networks (6 degrees of separation), WWW (19 clicks)
 ** contains a number of highly connected hubs
 ** degree distribution: random - poisson, scale-free - power law
 ** scale-free networks are robust to failure of nodes
 * evaluate growth of entities, model dynamic changes
 * similar to evolution of webpages
 * compute change in Pubrank over time
** Getting Rich with Data Mining
 * 75% of fund managers fail to beat the S&P 500 index
 * most fund managers use Modern Porfolio Theory (MPT) to create their portfolios
 * assumes that the price in the past can predict the price in the future
 * fundamental analysis
 * model as a bipartite graph, set of stocks, set of financial ratios
 * mine maximal quasi-bicliques to cluster stocks and financial ratios
** Protecting your data privacy
 * public health threat
 * using data mining for health monitoring, potential breach of individual's privacy
 * perturb the data by adding noise
 * privacy preserving data sharing
** Other projects
 * emergence/reemergence of infectious diseases, epitope prediction, computer aided vaccine design
 * traffic problems in highly urbanized cities, intelligent route planning
 * people want to be understood but they do not want to be known, anonymous data collection
** Observations
 * Data is king
 * Key features of real data
## lots of data
## different types of data
## large features few samples
## data can be wrong/incomplete
