TITLE: Size doesn't matter
Correlation between complexity and gene number is a loose one.

Considerable expansion of proteome relative to genome.

In the immune system, polymorphisms in the V, J and D regions can combine to
produce potentially billions of immunoglobulins from a set of genes many order
of magnitude smaller in number

Editing of mRNA (alternative splicing, RNA editing)

Increasing the size of regulatory elements allows for greater number of gene
expressions

PTM, ligand binding, binding to a membrane or another protein and even the
location can affect protein function

Moonlighting, eg PGI and neuroleukin are the same molecule
