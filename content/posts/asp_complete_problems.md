 * n-ASP
 ** given n solutions to a problem, find another one
 ** can be used to determine if the solution to a problem is unique
 * Function problem pi(D,S,G)
 ** D is a problem instance
 ** S is the solution space
 ** G maps each element of D to a subset of S
 ** pi_d of pi given x in D, does x has a solution in S (decision version)
 * pi is ASP-Complete => pi_d is NPC
 * SAT, 3-SAT, Just 1 SAT, 1 in 3 SAT, Triangle partitioning, Latin squares, Sudoku
 * Sudoku is ASP Complete => is also NP Complete
