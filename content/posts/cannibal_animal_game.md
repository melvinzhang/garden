Presented at AAAC 2011

Frank Harary generalized tic-tac-toe to an infinite board and the target is to
form an arbitary polynomino (or rotation/flip).

Game theoretic value for most polynomino known except for snaky.

Consider a new kind of game, where Alice and Bob moves are not the same.

Alice mark one square at a time, Bob put one whole copy of the animal (rotate,
flip) at a time.

Alice has a bounding strategy for certain polynominos
