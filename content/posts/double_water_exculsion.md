A hypothesis refining the O-ring theory for hot spots at protein interfaces
Speaker: Li Jinyan (SCE, NTU)
** Motivation
 * binding interfaces have high compatibility in 3D share and biochemical properties
 * hotspot in the binding interface consists of a small subset of residues, energetically important, any mutants result in energy loss
 * O-ring theory by Bogan and Thorn, JMB 1998
 ** hotspot surrounded by a ring of energetically less important residues
 ** these residues organized in a O-ring shape to block water molecules
** Contribution
 * Double water exclusion: in addition to O-ring, further assume that the hotspot itself is water free
 * Finding water free hotspoints
 ** binding chain pair represented as a bipartite graph, connect two residues if distance between them is small
 ** hotspots corresponds to maximal biclique
