** Early EV
early vehicles were electric, powerd by lead acid batteries. Thomas Edison invented one
competition from combustion engine
first hybrid gasoline-electric car developed in 1916

** Decline of EV
greater range required
ubiquity cheap oil, petroleum instead of whale oil or plant oils
advances in combustion engine

** EVs today
largest truck, largest cruise ship
tesla model s
personal mobility devices

advances in electric motors
advances in battery technologies
increased sensitivity to environmental concerns

** converting a combustion engine motorcycle to electric
lithium ion phosphate cells
need to fit the components into the body of the vehicle
tested the performance of the vehicle
participated in the WAVE rally and came in 3rd in the motorcycle category

** replacing the OBM of a yacht with electric motor
making the sailing vessel carbon neutral
recharge the batteries with solar panels, mounted on a truss

** Snowstorm
needed 18 propellors and 6 batteries
shipped it to London

** The Delta
for National Geographic series Machine Impossible, a flying electric car
designed a paraglider trike, build it in 2.5 months
