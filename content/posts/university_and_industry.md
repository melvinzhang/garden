{"title": "University and Industry", "tags": ["advise"]}

A rather common complaint I've heard about our courses is that there is too
much focus on abstract theory and other seemingly useless materials and too
little on practical skills and technologies being used in the industry. The
underlying assumption is that Universities are simply producing skilled workers
for the industry.

However, I feel that such a view of university education is fundamentally
flawed. IMHO, the purpose of universities is for the advancement and
dissemination of knowledge. That the knowledge will be useful in one's career
later is simply a beneficial side effect. Tagging university education to the
industry is also detrimental in other ways. The industry is usually rather
volatile, the set of skills required in a particular job is always changing as
new technologies appear on the scene. Rather than attempting to follow the
whims of the industry, the universities covers fundamental
principles/techniques rather than technologies and tools. The focus is on
understand why something works rather than just being able to make use of it.
