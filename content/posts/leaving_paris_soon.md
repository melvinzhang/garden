My trip to Paris for the RECOMB Comparative Genomics workshop is coming to an
end. It has been a great week.

The [RECOMB Comparative Genomics Workshop](http://igm.univ-mlv.fr/RCG08/) was
held from Monday to Wednesday. My talk was on the second day, it went smoothly
but ended a little early. There was only one question, but after the talk a
couple of people came and gave me some suggestions. On the same day as my talk,
there was a dinner cruise on the river Seine and I got to meet some other folks
during the dinner. All in all, it was a great conference as the topics
discussed are closely related to my own work.

The only problem I encountered was being unable to use my N82 to take
pictures. Meddling with the settings and doing a reset did not help, in the end
I had to buy 2 disposable cameras.

After the conference ended on Wednesday, I visited Le Panth√©on. The most
interesting part is the underground crypt, which houses the remains of
distinguished citizens of France, including Marie Curie. Given the number of
CRPG games with crypt levels, I was half expecting skeletons and zombies to
jump out at me. After that, I went to Jardin du Luxembourg, the largest park in
Paris. It was a refreshing change from the concrete jungle of the city.

The first half of Thursday was spent visiting Prof Frej Tekaia. We had a
good discussion on some research problems of mutual interest. After that, I
went to see the Eiffel Tower, it looks a lot bigger up close as compared to
when I saw it from afar during the dinner cruise.

Finally on Friday, I visited the Louvre Museum and saw the Mona Lisa, among
many other sculptors and paintings. Personally, I don't quite understand why
the Mona Lisa is so famous. The last place I visited was the La Grande Galerie
de l'Evolution (roughly translated as Grand Gallery of Evolution),I found it
more fascinating than the Louvre.

Hopefully, the pictures from the disposable camera can be developed. Then
I'll scan them and add them to this post.
