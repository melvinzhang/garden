Title: Translog: a web browser for studying the expression divergence of homologous genes
WWW: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/S1/S59

HCNE: highly conserved non coding elements, appears to have long range
interactions with genes, up to 2Mbp

CAGE: cap analysis of gene epxression, for finding TSS using tags

Divergence of gene expression for paralogs due to WGD

Also shows conserved neigborhood

One gene - multiple transcripts

For orthologous genes, which transcript are othologous?
