{"title": "Session 36: Nasal irrigation", "tags": []}

* our body produces 1-1.5l of mucus a day, it slides down our throat
* during an infection mucus may be blocked and do not drain out properly
* it comes thick as it drys and may turn yellow due to an enzyme produced by antibodies
* nasal irrigation flushes saline water into sinuses to help flush out the thick mucus and relieve symptoms
