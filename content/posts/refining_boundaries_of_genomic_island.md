genomic island is genomic region acquired via lateral gene transfer

several mechanisms of lateral gene transfer: conjugation, transduction, etc

GI are crucial for microbial genome evolution and adaptation of microbes to the environment
* pathogenesis
* antimicrobial resistance

GI have different GC content from the core genome

methods based on sequence composition
* window based methods
* recursive segmentation

AlienHunter uses HMM to refine the boundary found from window based method
