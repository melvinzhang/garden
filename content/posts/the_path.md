Use rituals to change ourselves by changing how we approach them. Similar to improvisation in Jazz to achieve harmony.
Any pattern of interation is a ritual, playing hide and seek with a child, 3 meals a day, etc.
Rituals may also have an "as if"/roleplay component, son pretends to be the diseased grandfather.
These allow us to break out of our usual patterns and try something different.

There is no true self. We can change who we are, how we feel, and how react. The world is also constantly changing.
We have inherent goodness but it needs to be cultivated. Take note of our emotion/responses and how they affect others.
