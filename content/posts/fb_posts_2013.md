Dec 25: Talk by Joey Hess at DebConf 13 -- "A whirlwind tour of the past and future history of Debian, from as close to our big bang as can still be observed, through the geological present of the last internet decade, and beyond. With stops along the way to peer into some wormholes to alternate universes of app stores, cell phones, and derivative distributions. It's all about the big questions, not any particular answers."

Dec 24: Difference between Unison and git-annex: unison requires direct connection to sync, it only does pairwise folder syncing, more than 2 replicas have to sync via a central replica. git-annex knows all the replicas and it is able to sync between two clients without direct connection using a cloud storage backend as an intermediary.

Dec 23: "Gilad Bracha explains how to distinguish FP hype from reality and to apply key ideas of FP in non-FP languages, separating the good parts of FP from its unnecessary cultural baggage."
http://www.infoq.com/presentations/functional-pros-cons

Dec 22: Open source folder syncing with support for multiple server backends (S3, Glacier, rsync, etc). Considering replacing my current Unison based system with this.

Nov 29: Continuing with the videos to watch from JVMLS 2013. If you think compiling a statically typed language like Scala to the JVM is hard, hear about the tricks that the Nashorn (Javascript to JVM compiler) team pulled to get decent performance for a dynamically typed language on the JVM.

Nov 19: #TIL you have to be in the video group to access the graphics chip driver. I can haz WebGL now :)

Nov 18: #TIL When using LLVM, prefer opt to llvm-as for converting from human readable LLVM IR to bitcode. This change reduces the running time of scheme2llvm compiling itself from 21s to 7s.

Nov 17: libgc successfully integrated! Compiler now able to compile its own source code. The output of string constants in IR is not exactly the same as that generated by interpreted compiler... Almost there

Oct 27: "The primary and direct value that games have for us is that they teach us how to learn. They provide an environment for us to focus on increasing a specific skill or set of skills. They teach us to formulate tactics, to second-guess our thinking, and to commit to a strategy. Quite simply, they allow us to train ourselves as thinkers." -- Keith Burgun, Game Design Theory: A New Philosophy for Understanding Games

Oct 26: Awesome Gosling live demo for the last segment.
http://medianetwork.oracle.com/video/player/2698223954001

Oct 26: Lambda is the single largest upgrade to the programming model. Ever. It's larger even than Generics. It's the first time since the beginning of Java that we've done a carefully coordinated co-evolution of the virtual machine, the language and the libraries, all together. Yet the result still feels like Java. -- Mark Reinhold

Aug 02: The gamer mentality is essential for survival and for leveling up in virtual worlds. Conquering the quest and winning the battle is only one reason to game.  The other is feeling the rush of the quest, the pure joy of the challenge, the satisfaction that comes from knowing you have beaten your own score.

But do these rules apply to life and business?

Face the challenge. Play to win. Because Life is Just a Game. -- talk by Tan Min-Liang, Co-Founder & CEO of Razor at U@live 7:30pm 28th Aug Shaw Foundation Alumni House.

Mar 09: Fixed time minimax, an alternative to iterative deepening. Idea: parameterize minimax with ending time, t_end, instead of max depth. If now > t_end, return score. Else expand current node, let t_left = t_end - now. Suppose n has c children, recursive explore the children with minimax setting t_end to now + t_left/c.

This idea came to be a couple of day ago but I can't seem to find any related work. Has anyone read something similar to this?
