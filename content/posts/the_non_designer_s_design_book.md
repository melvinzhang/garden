# Proximity
Related items should be close together. Provides a clear structure. Think about
how the eye should move. There should be a logical progression.

Avoid too many separate elements on a page.

# Alignment
Nothing should be placed arbitrarily. Every elements should have a visual
connection to some other element.

Avoid using more than one text alignment on the page. Try to break away from a
centered alignment unless you are consciously trying to create a more formal,
sedate presentation.

# Repetition
Repeat visual elements to strengthen the unity. Adds visual interest.

# Contrast
Avoid elements that are similar. If they are different make then very
different. Most important visual attraction on a page. Aids in organization of
the information. Be strong!

# Extra tips and tricks
Creating a package, make use of repetitive elements.

Create a focal point. One element should dominant.

Use subheads that contrast.

# Categories of type
Oldstyle (based on the handlettering of scribes)

Modern (radical thick/thin transition, vertical stress)

Slab serif (little or no thick/thin transition, thicker strokes)

Sans Serif (no serif)

Script (handlettered with a calligraphy pen or brush)

Decorative

# Type contrasts
Size: big/small

Weight: thickness of the stroke

Structure: how a letter is build, thick/thin transition

Form: shape of the letter (lowercase vs uppercase). Text in all caps is harder
to read because they have a similar rectangular shape.

Direction: how does the text flow (horizontal vs narrow columns)

Color: warm colors command our attention, cool colors recede from our eyes

# The process
Start with the focal point. What do you want your reader to see first?

Group your information into logical groups. Create and maintain strong alignments.

Create a repetition or find items that can have a repetitive connection.

Create strong contrasts to attract the reader's eye.
