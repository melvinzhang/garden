Haven't been updaing for while, a lot has happened since my last post. I've
completed my Computer Science PhD at NUS and I'm now working at
[Hoiio](http://hoiio.com) in the API team.

The closure of Posterous forced me to do something to keep the site online.
I've decided to migrate to [Octopress](http://octopress.org) as it generates a
set of static files, currently hosted on GitHub Pages.

One of the benefits of using my own domain is that I'm able to preserve any
existing links that point to the old Posterous hosted site. Migration from
Posterous to Octopress is a lot easier than I expected by following the
instruction from [here](http://blog.mikebourgeous.com/2013/04/29/how-i-migrated-from-posterous-to-octopress/).
