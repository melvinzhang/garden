# Time management
\subsection{Stage I: random reading (1 month)}
purpose is to generate an idea for a paper

spend an hour or so every other day looking through recent issues of journals/conference proceedings

read an average of one article a day, including weekends

put in an hour or two of work each morning, first thing

identify the pressing questions, issues and major references

look out for references to unsolved problems or unanswered questions

write a 200 word ABSTRACT of proposed research

\subsection{Stage II: focussed reading (1 month)}
purpose is to collect and organize the information needed to write up the idea

collect relevant articles, follow references from recent articles on the topic

be open to articles that present a variety of viewpoints and types of evidence, especially opposing ones

absence of research about your topic

go through each article, make notes and highlight passages that you want to quote or evidence that you want to cite

copy any material you think you might use onto note cards, one note/quote per card

\subsection{Stage III: first draft (2 weeks)}
getting the first draft on paper is the most difficult

process of transferring cards onto paper should be done without regards for precise wording

reorganize as necessary, add transitions, add introduction and conclusion

finally revise at the sentence and word levels

make the argument/key ideas transparent

\subsection{Stage IV: final draft (2 weeks)}
solicit criticism and revise accordingly

give reviewer at least a week to look over the manuscript

ask for feedback on particular areas/sections

give reviewer some idea of what you want to do with the manuscript

accept feedback graciously and assess it judiciously

put the manuscript aside for a few days and come back and read it fresh

# Book review
scholarly books, textbooks and collections of articles

at least one month: 2 weeks to read the book, a week to digest it and a week to write the review

\subsection{textbook review}
description (including chapter titles), purpose

2-3 notable strengths and weaknesses

overall evaluation

\subsection{collections}
evaluative as well as descriptive

characterize the book as a whole,

what were the editor's goals and how well were they achieved

major themes, how well do papers represent the theme/topic

# Abstract
abbreviated version of a paper, 100-250 words

topic abstract or thesis abstract

background, purpose, methodology, results

# Conference Presentation
speak extemporaneously

stay within the time limit

use a visual aid (show and tell)

handouts should be short (at most 2 pages), simple and dependent upon interpretation

oral presentation is an advertisement for the paper, purpose is to persuade the audience to read the paper

# Response Article
summarize in general terms the original article

enumerate claims and state objections

use a positive tone

should be self-contained, response should be impersonal and unemotional

# Research Article
\subsection{Problem}
lay out the rationale for writing the paper

unsolved problem, unanswered question, inconsistency in the literature, unexplained phenomenon

"why is it important for me to know this?"

\subsection{Approach}
explain the technical, theoretical or background information necessary to solve the problem

"why is this so confusing?"

\subsection{Solution}
author's approach is applied to some domain of data in order to solve the problem

"what is the author's point?"

# Sections of a Paper
\subsection{Introductions}
serve as a map to guide the reader

must engage the reader quickly and convincingly

what's the problem?

what's been said about it by others?

what have I got to say about it?

how am I going to say it?

\subsection{Examples}
serve as bridges between the abstract and the concrete

provide evidence to support the thesis

abstraction: simple statement of the point

illustration: data that supports the abstraction

interpretation: spell out how the illustration embodies the abstraction

constructed vs live examples

academic writing is didactic: to explain theories to the reader

\subsection{Figures}
a picture of an idea

serving as illustration in an example

point of focus

\subsection{Metalanguage}
series of guide posts for the reader

tell the reader how to interpret what follows

without metalanguage, the read learns the facts but not their significance

\subsection{Conclusions}
essentially a thesis abstract of the paper

should be self contained, problem-approach-solution

abstraction-illustration-interpretation

should not introduce anything new, but should bring up related topics for future research
