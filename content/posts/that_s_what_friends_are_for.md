And I never thought I'd feel this way

And as far as I'm concerned

I'm glad I got the chance to say

That I do believe I love you

And if I should ever go away

Well then close your eyes and try

To feel the way we do today

And then if you can remember

**Chorus**

Keep smiling, keep shining

Knowing you can always count on me, for sure

That's what friends are for

For/In good times and/in bad times

I'll be on your side forever more

That's what friends are for

Well you came and opened me

And now there's so much more I see

And so by the way I thank you

And then for the times when we're apart

Well then close your eyes and know

These words are coming from my heart

And then if you can remember

Repeat chorus three times
