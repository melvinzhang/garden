the offline experience drive traffic to AirBnB
first time users come via word of mouth

show information to promote a sense of urgency
** drive visitors to the site
on-boarding new users

naturally high
** crawling altavista
wrote a crawler in perl that took down the site
denial-of-service did not catch it as the requests were coming from an internal IP
** make sure what you are working on is working for you
doing well at Yahoo, but Yahoo itself was on the downward spiral
from director of engineering to engineering manager at facebook
** engineering culture
agency, having a say on the right solution to a given problem
involved right from the start, during the ideation phase
** bringing up a marketplace
building a sense of trust, review and reputation system
managing the community
low friction, especially for payment
** increasing the review rate
AirBnB have very high review rate, around 80%
users are worried that reviews will offend and affect the home owner's review
introduce a simultaneous release of review from user and home owner
** technology adoption
RoR is sufficient for the frontend, though it is not the most performant
standardize on JVM languages for services, Java and Scala, for ease of operations
** hiring
lucky to have a ready stream of candidates
creating a highly diverse team is the challenge
** integrating design
leadership team on a project includes product manager, enginering, designer,
data scientist
