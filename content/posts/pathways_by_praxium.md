One activity for the entire session
* brief: create a app to help match students to industry
* requirement gathering
* matching students to industry (industry as a card with capacity)
  * similar to secondary school posting
  * second school posting uses serial dictatorship
* each student rank every industry (print cards with ranks)
* how to compare different assignments?
* do manual assignment to get the best
* develop an algorithm to do the assignment
* develop UI for an web-based app
* present their work to other groups

Activity 1: Write the instructions
* Hard to express the diagram precisely in English
Activity 2: Instruct the robot arm
* New theme for the marble machine to make the link to IT clearer
Activity 3: Should we do that?
* Should we create automated agents that can choose and attack people in a war?
* Should we create a system to monitor everyone's Internet usage to help catch criminals?
* Should we create an automated system, e.g. driverless cars, that will displace many jobs?
* Should we create automated agents to manipulate human behavior, e.g. recommend videos to increase time spent on YouTube/TikTok?
* (Optional) Explain your reasoning for the above question.

* Instead of looking at to accomplish the goal, let's think about whether we should do it
* There may be negative consequences of what we build.

* first time doing activity 1 with printed diagram and written instructions
* first time doing activity 3
* skipped activity 2

Perhaps do Tic-Tac-Toe AI instead of Minsky Machine?

Alternative goal for Minsky Machine that is scalable. Starting with n boxes in
box A, using at most m instructions, make the total number of boxes to be as
large as possible. The flow chart must terminate.

01/04/2022 at St Joseph's Institution
* first time doing Tic-Tac-Toe AI, went well. Show them evaluator but don't give them the URL yet.
* did "Should we do that?" with mentimeter and short response

Warm up the audience first. Ask them questions.
* What software do you use daily?
* How do you think software is produced?

25/05/2022 at St Pat and 26th at St Gab
* What less common softare do you use?
* Ask them to defeat the sample TTT AI. Prepare a harder version with only 1 way to lose.
