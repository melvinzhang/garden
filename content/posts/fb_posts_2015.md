Dec 29: Great talk on using tools to increase iteration speed of a small team.

The part that made me smile was the use of a bot to record the solution of puzzle and replaying it to recheck every puzzle in less than an hour. This enables the team to edit the level design and physics while ensuring that the game can still be completed.

In Magarena, we use AI vs AI in a similar fashion, to check that various card interactions do not result in an exception.

Oct 15: schema is an awesome library for working with structured data in Clojure. Using it to parse query params and validate JSON response from an API I'm working on.

Bonus: perhaps someone on the team has a cat named melvin?

Oct 11: My talk on Magarena's AI at GeekCamp.SG is now online. The organizers did a great job recording and publishing the talks. Normally I'd avoid watching recordings, but in this case I thought I'd better look through it before posting. Just noticed I tend to overuse the word "so".

Oct 03: "Racket's Universe library is the foundation of the long-running Bootstrap and ProgramByDesign K-12 outreach projects. The library's exports make algebra come alive. With big-bang, a middle-school student's "hello world" program simulates a rocket lift-off. More generally, middle school students can formulate interactive, graphical programs---animations, video games, or simple editors---with algebra. Even evaluating these programs uses nothing but algebraic calculations." Tag: @[678566238:2048:Hon Wai Leong] @[771589622:2048:Jason Yeo]

Sep 13: On using the right language (mouse trap) to express solutions/programs (mice). At 45:20, Ian demos a Smalltalk DSL embedded in a Lisp that runs the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm and visualizes the result with ASCII art.

Unfortunately it only works with the Lisp interpreter written in C and not the one written in itself. Made further progress in extending the self-interpreter to run the demo @ https://github.com/melvinzhang/maru

Sign of a great developer: they continue to support and update their games long after the initial release.

Jun 01: Release 1.62 of Magarena is out with more than 200 cards added. The first release under my care was release 1.14 (May 2011), in the last four years we have consistently put up one release every month. The number of supported cards have grown significantly since then, from 901 cards in 1.14 to the current 9,497. We manage to avoid a corresponding increase in the code base by aggressively refactoring card code and supporting common templates in our card script system.

May 24: TIL that Turing never uses the word "halting" in his 1936 paper. He preferred his machines to run forever printing the binary digits of a computable real. The halting problem was coined by Martin Davis. Turing uses the phrase "circular" (prints only a finite number of digits) and "circle-free" (prints an infinite number of digits).

May 20: I'll be presenting a talk/demo on functional programming at next Friday's Hackers & Painters lunch time sharing session.

Trivia: why do we use the λ symbol to denote functions?

May 16: One of the few regrets I have of Uni is not taking a course in computability/complexity theory. While doing a search for books on this topic, I came across this gem by Neil D. Jones.

"Unfortunately, the field is well-known for impenetrable fundamental definitions, proofs of theorems, and even statements of theorems and definitions of problems. In my opinion this owes to some extent to the history of the field, and that a shift away from the Turing machine- and Godel number-oriented classical approaches toward a greater use of concepts familiar from programming languages will render classical computability and complexity results more accessible to the average computer scientist, and can make its very strong theorems more visible and applicable to practical problems." -- preface of Computability and Complexity from a Programming Perspective.

The book is available as a pdf download from the author's website.

May 14: TIL that the "recursion" in recursion theory actually means computability.

May 01: Magarena 1.61 is out. We've started to work on in-game card rendering, good chance it will be ready for the next release.

Apr 22: Excerpts from PM's speech:
"I take a personal interest in this. 40 years ago, after doing a math degree, I went on to study computer science, on my father’s advice.  He said there is a future in that, and he was right."

"The last program I wrote was a Sudoku solver in C++ several years ago, so I’m out of date.  My children are in IT, two of them – both graduated from MIT.  One of them browsed a book and said, “Here, read this”.  It said “Haskell – learn you a Haskell for great good”, and one day that will be my retirement reading."

"The best AI agents do not need to be brilliant, they need to be believable. As AI developers, our goal is only for players to believe behavior is intelligent, rather than filling in all the blanks: "less is more". I will provide concrete techniques for designing effective AI systems. I'll talk about my process for creating Stanley, the AI in ROCKETSROCKETROCKETS, and how that can be applied to other games, as well as look at other AI examples from my own work and other games to help illustrate the techniques."

Mar 16: Inspired by last year's Hour of Code at the Science Center, we're back with a public exhibit at the Science Center (Wed, 18th March, 1-5pm) to explain computing concepts and to debunk the myth that computing is only about computers.

Fun fact: before the invention of electronic computers, a computer is "one who computes", a person performing calculations according to a set of fixed rules.

Mar 07: Inspired by http://tests.stockfishchess.org/, I asked Mike, the developer of firemind.ch, if we can do something similar for Magarena which would allow us to test AI code by evaluating its win rate on many games.

First working prototype of the feature is now on firemind! Excited to begin testing different hypothesis I have on improving the AI.

Jan 27: "In the same way that composition and comprehension are not tied to paper, modeling is not tied to computers. It can be both physical and mental. It takes place on paper and in Excel or with Legos and balsa wood airplanes. It is an incredibly powerful skill which we can make even greater use of by transposing our models to computers. To understand how we do that, we have to look more deeply at what it means to model."
