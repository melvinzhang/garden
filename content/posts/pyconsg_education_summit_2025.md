# BEBRAS to NOI
Sophie Koh, SIMCC

Nature of tasks similar to BEBRAS

NJIO = CT + Python
* previously known as Dr CT
* online and paper based for inclusivity
* qns include code snippets, students do not need to write Python
  * they need to read and understand Python programs

# PCDIT chatbot

All SUTD students learn programming.

Novice programmers don't have any patterns to fallback on
* start with concrete cases, solve it manually

James Prather: the widening gap when novice programmers using GenAI

Explicit to implicit after lots of practice

# Scaffolding the problem solving process

Ashish taught a CT course for those intending to do a CS minor

Ask students to design additional tasks that can be solved with the same pattern

Polya step 4: generalize from the solution of the task into a general pattern
* find sum of 1 to n -> accumulator pattern

Two lectures to cover the problem solving process

# Fun and purpose

Lim Jing-Yi, simplelittle.com

micropython line follower
* making the car go faster
* figure of 8

google dinosaur
* open cv to check if person jumps, then trigger the dino to jump

type with your eyes

my suggestion: open cv to control your mouse
