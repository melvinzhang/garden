** event driven predictions
E=(O_1, P, O_2, T)
O = object
P = action
T = timestamp
open information extraction
** categorize each event as either positive or negative on the stock
using SVM and neural network
** evaluation
accuracy and MCC metric
** conclusion
events > bag of words
non linear model > linear model
** represent an event as a vector
neural tensor network
** take into account long term effect of events
convolution neural network and max pooling for long term and mid term
events
