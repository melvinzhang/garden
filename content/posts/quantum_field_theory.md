{"title": "quantum field theory", "tags": []}

unifies classical field theory [quantum mechanics]({{< relref "quantum_mechanics" >}}) and [special relativity]({{< relref "special_relativity" >}})

quantum electrodynamics
* electron field and photon field
* Feynman diagram
  * interaction vertices, loops
  * corresponds to an equation
  * has a corresponding amplitude
* only initial and final particles are real
  * the intermediate ones are virtual

quantum chromodynamic
* quarks and gluons
