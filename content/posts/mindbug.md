* Only use a mindbug in a true emergency.
* Play as aggressive as possible, force the opponent to use their mindbugs and force them to play cards from their hand.
* Do all you can to avoid playing a card. If you must play a card, choose the best in the current situation and choose one which you have a solution for if the opponent mindbug it.
* Save the best cards for the end.
* Try not do any mistakes.
