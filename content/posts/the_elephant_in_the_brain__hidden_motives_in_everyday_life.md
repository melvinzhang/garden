[Review on nintil](https://nintil.com/this-review-is-not-about-reviewing-the-elephant-in-the-brain/)
* evolutionary explanations for our behaviours, we are largely selfish but generally unaware
* our cognition is biased and imperfect, "weakly self-deceived" (eg. confirmation bias, self-serving bias, social desirability bias)
* large scale social patterns as in education or healthcare can be explained in a substantial part by these biases
