Nov 15: West side Learning Day happening tonight! Lots of nostalgia for me as the first Learning Day I attended was also held in Bold At Work.

Aug 24: Replaying Liberation Circuit while I'm making the game more modable with Lua scripting. In the process of converting each mission to its own lua script instead of being hardcoded in C. I'd have to clear the previous missions to get to the one I'm converting. This is going be interesting, last time I played I got stuck in an early mission. Now I can just edit its script to make it easier.

Aug 24: LuaJIT's C FFI is a joy to use and just works. Just declare the functions and use it in the script, eg https://github.com/melvinzhang/liberation-circuit/blob/lua/bin/story/tutorial/tute1/tute1.lua

Jul 14: TIL there is a 14 line program that runs forever iff the Riemann Hypothesis is true. Program in link.

Jul 03: It finally dawned on me why warehousing has such a rich structure and interesting computational problems. It is the "data structure"  of logistics.

Data structure = method of organizing information for efficient modification and access

Warehouse = method of organizing physical items for efficient modification and access

Jan 12: Did not expect to see this on a strength training blog but as @[678566238:2048:Hon Wai Leong] always say, algorithms are anywhere and everywhere. Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised because the planning of which exercises to do each session is also called programming.

Jan 07: My talk at GeekCampSG 2018+ is now online. Thanks to Engineers.SG for recording and GeekCampSG for the wonderful event. I was lucky the timing turned out well, I was worried it would take too long, especially with the demos.
