{"title": "Don Norman on creating great software", "tags": ["talk"]}
Design guru Don Norman gave a excellent talk on what makes great software at the [http://www.businessofsoftware.org/|Business of Software conference] in 2009.

I've heard about Don from his book, "The Design of Everyday Things".  I watched the talk to find out more about how some of the design principles from his earlier works apply to building software. Highly recommend for people interested in how to improve the way we interact with software.
