EuPathDB: Eukaryotic Pathogen Database Resources

Uses Genomic Unified Scheme to organize omics data

Allows many different ways of searching the data

Uses "Strategies" system (GUI) to specify a new workflow

Database federation allows heterogeneity (different underlying DBMS),
distribution (different places), autonomy.

Entrez, Biomart are other examples of database federation.

Key architecture:
* Genomics Unified Scheme
* WDK
* Web services
* Database federation

Setup Schistosoma japonicum genome database. Generated and annotated in China
but no central location to hold the data.

Install and configure db, UI in SCBIT. Get a pipeline to load SJ data and
integerate with EuPathDB portal

Using the framework of EuPathDB to develop EUPGI to provide additional
services such as search and tools.

Provide interface to smart phone (eg BioTechniques.com)
