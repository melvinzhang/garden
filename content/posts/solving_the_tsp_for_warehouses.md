{"title": "Solving the TSP for warehouses", "tags": ["contrib"]}

As E-commerce becomes more prevalent, most of us make our purchases online
instead of shopping in person. Pickers are responsible for gathering our orders
from various parts of the warehouse. They spend up to 60% of the time walking
from one product to the next.

Picker routing is an example of the Travelling Salesman Problem. Although the
TSP is hard to solve in general, in the case of moving around a warehouse, we
can exploit the restricted movement to develop efficient algorithms. This talk
will cover recent advances in solving the TSP for such cases.
