First learning day. Found out from FB when GP responded to the event.

Shared about big five workout from Body by Science
* 15 mins per week vs 150 mins, 3 times a week
* 5 compound movements
* horizontal push, pull
* vertical push, pull
* leg push
* TUL not reps, aim for 60 to 90s until failure
* exercise to break down muscle, not to burn calorie
* recovery to build up muscle
