Problems in science class
* passive learning
* concepts that are impossible to see

Bringing the lab to the classroom
* Arvind Gupta toys
* ExpEYES - Pocket Science Lab

Copper coils and magnet used to light an LED

Rotate the magnet with a motor and use it to light an LED

Learn by doing

Python to plot a function for visualization
* damped sine wave
* VPython

Pocket Science Lab
* coupled pendulum
* motion graphs
* oscilloscope to show phase of AC current generated by coil

Mirrors mounted on speakers perpendicular to each other
* one moves the laser horizontally, the other vertically
* alternatively using rotating mirrors
