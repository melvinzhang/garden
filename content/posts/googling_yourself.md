At the NOI awards ceremony yesterday, I met up with Mr Gi Soong Chee, a
Computing teacher at Dunman High, whom I met during IOI 2005. It was nice to
see him again and catch up on what we've been up to in the last couple of
years. At the end of our conversation, he asked for my email address. I wrote
it on a piece of paper and jokingly added that he could have googled me for the
information. I assumed that since I have this website, it will be indexed by
Google and people who want to contact me can find my information here.

Actually, I've never actually tried to google for my own info so I'm not sure
if it would actually work. To test it out, I tried the following queries in
Google today.

Query: melvin

Result (rank):

* [http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~melvin/](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Emelvin/) (9)

Query: melvin nus

Result (rank):

* [http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~melvin/](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Emelvin/) (1)
* [http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~noi/infonoi.html](http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/%7Enoi/infonoi.html) (2)
* [http://algorithmics.comp.nus.edu.sg/wiki/](http://algorithmics.comp.nus.edu.sg/wiki/) (3)</td>

Query: melvin zhang
Result (rank):

* [http://algorithmics.comp.nus.edu.sg/wiki/](http://algorithmics.comp.nus.edu.sg/wiki/) (1)
* CS1102 Tut 10 Summary (2)
* My talk for the NUS ACM chapter (4,5)</td>

The results were somewhat surprising. First of all, I was surprised to be even
on the first page of Google for “melvin” alone. The other interesting result,
was how much I'm associated with NUS. A search for “melvin nus” gave more
relevant pages as compared to a search for “melvin zhang”.

Have you tried to Google for you own info and were you surprised by what you found?
