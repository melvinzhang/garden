Title: The Regulatory Genome and the Computing: Theory and Practice

Joint work with Erik Davidson

** CYRENE Project
The Gene Naming Problem
 * translation table approach
 * "the fight for data"

The Sequence Bottleneck Problem
 * how to represent the binding sites
 * consensus sequence not good enough

The Logic Inference Problem
 * how to determine the logic of cis regulation from experiments

** Sea Urchin: genome, transcriptome, logicome

The sea urchin provided fundamental insights into basic biology

The logicome
 * combinatorial logic functions
 * and, short range repression, switch toggle, etc

The regulatory genome and the computer (ref Von Neumann's book)

Example of Rube Goldberg's pencil sharpener

The cis-trans embrace, cis = DNA, trans = transcription factor
