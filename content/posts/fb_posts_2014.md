Dec 31: One more release just before the end of December, makes 12 releases in 12 months. Bringing us from 1.46 in January to 1.57 in December, with a total of 3612 cards added.

Dec 18: The AI of Prismata = Monte-Carlo Tree Search + specialize algorithms to generate small set of "good" actions based on domain knowledge. Eerily similar to what we have in Magarena. Their use of AI for game balance testing might be something new though.

The Kickstarter campaign is winding down. Lets hit some stretch goals!

Dec 16: First pull request!
https://github.com/magarena/magarena/pull/49

Dec 15: Code for the "Design your own Tic-Tac-Toe AI activity" developed during the Hour of Code SG event at the Singapore Science Center. Participants code their own AI (by giving a preference order for each square) and we will try to play against it and discover its strengths and weakness.

Then we show how programs can be used to automate the tedious task of testing the AI. We'll use the code in the repo to find counterplays and quantitatively compute the strength of the AI.

The code can also be used to enumerate all 9! possible programs. There are some interesting ones, such as [[2 6 8] [5 9 1] [3 4 7]], that has only one way to beat it when it plays as first player.

Dec 06: "In the summer of 2010, they invented a tabletop card game and became obsessed with it. They did not know it then, but that was the beginning of Prismata."

I've got an extra alpha key from the Kickstarter campaign, drop me a PM if you like to check it out. The TLDR is Prismata = Dominion - randomness + combat

Nov 29: From Dec 8 - 14 at the Singapore Science Center

Nov 28: Demo for Prismata, a game inspired by Magic, Chess, Dominion, and StarCraft. It reminds me of turn-based battle systems in early Final Fantasy games, except instead of building up your team by leveling up/getting equipment, you use economic units like in RTS to gain resources to build stronger units.

One of the few games doing F2P right, where supporters get cosmetic items/additional missions. Just crossed the 50% mark on their Kickstarter, when it seemed almost impossible just a few days ago when I backed.

Nov 22: > Think "turn-based StarCraft", but without a map. Or, think of Hearthstone with workers and build orders instead of decks.

The choice to remove randomness and hidden information in gameplay makes this a pure skill game that is closer to classics like Go and Chess. Will this be able to break into the e-sports scene? I hope they succeed.

>  [Prismata's AI] framework involves using Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

Can't wait to get my alpha keys to test our their AI.

Oct 19: Turned based card game using concepts from Dominion and RTS mechanics to be a finite, zero-sum, two-player game with perfect information. Fixed set of units at start (no deck building), any unit can be played when you have sufficient resources (no card draw, no hidden hand), win by destroying the other player's units.
