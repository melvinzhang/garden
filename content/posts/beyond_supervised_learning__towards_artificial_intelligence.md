Example of machine learning
* predicting the eruption of geyser in yellowstone

PAC learning

"All belief comes from Syllogism or Induction"
intelligence = logic + learning

Robust Logic
* Scenes on t objects (Mind's eye, working memory)
* RHS of rule, R(x_3, x_4)
* LHS of rule, linear inequality over compound features
* leverage chaining of rules

PAC learning of Rules
