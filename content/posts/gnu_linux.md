{"title": "GNU/Linux", "tags": []}

For a programmer, the Unix like environment provided by GNU/Linux is miles
ahead of what is available on Windows. It is extremely easy to install most of
the development tools with just a single command.

I converted from Windows to GNU/Linux over a series of steps.
1. starting with using cygwin under Windows
1. moving to dual boot
1. finally getting rid of Windows altogether

My current distribution of choice is [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/).
AFAIK, it is the only Debian derivative that uses a rolling release, making it
possible to update without needed to reinstall.
