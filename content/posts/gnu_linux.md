{"title": "GNU/Linux", "tags": []}

For a programmer, the Unix like environment provided by GNU/Linux is miles
ahead of what is available on Windows. It is extremely easy to install most of
the development tools with just a single command.

I switched from Windows to GNU/Linux over a series of steps.
1. starting with using Cygwin under Windows
1. using GNU/Linux inside a VM
1. dual booting

Cygwin has been superceeded by [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about).

My current distribution is [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/).
AFAIK, it is the only Debian derivative that uses a rolling release, making it
possible to update without needing to reinstall.

Using the kali-last-snapshot branch for more stability as it undergoes release testing.
All else fails, there is [linux recovery]({{< relref "linux_recovery" >}})
