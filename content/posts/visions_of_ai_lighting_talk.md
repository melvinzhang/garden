Computer vision for intelligent systems by Gim Hee Lee, NUS

Formal methods in AI by Kuldeep Meel, NUS
* provably correct systems
  * provably correct probabilistic reasoning
* explainability
  * interpretable learning
* verification
  * verfication of probabilistic AI systems

Machine reasoning and deep spiking networks by Shaowei Lin, SUTD
* have neural and symbolic modules the work together
* homotopy type theory as the logical language
* robust learning of sequences (paths)

Transfer learning by Sinno Pan, NTU
* No knowledge accumulation, need to extract the knowledge learned
* vector of weights is too abstract to represent knowledge
* graphical models as the bridge between NN weights and first order logic

When AI meets Game Theory by Bo An, NTU
* GT for security, security resource scheduling
* GT for urban intelligence, optimal policy making, dynamic ERP
* adversarial machine learning
  * combating fraud on Alibaba using deep RL

Preferences and recommendations from Data and AI by Hady Lauw, SMU
* multi-modal preference signals
  * reviews
  * photos
  * rating
* visual sentiment analysis
* comparison of products in review/tweets
* preference from social links

Towards collaborating human-machine intelligent systems by Harold Soh, NUS
* machines should account for human psychology
* joint decision-making
* rich way interactions, then learn from it

State of the art in Language Error Correction by Ng Hwee Tou, NUS
* errors in writing, grammatical, word choice
* modeled as a machine translation from "bad English" to "good English"

Human centric AI by Jiewen Wu, AStar

multi agent planning in urban environment by Akshat Kumar, SMU SIS
* reason with aggregate data using collective graphical models

Clinical data analysis, Rajan, NUS IS
* multiview
* clustering

Data privacy for machine learning, NUS
* 33 bits of data to identify an individual
* black box access to machine learning models can leak data
  * reconstruction attack, tracing attack
* model that generalize should also be privacy preserving
  * does not depend on individual training records
* privacy needs to done during training
