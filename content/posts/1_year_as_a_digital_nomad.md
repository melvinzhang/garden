** built beatrixapp.com
** about $2K USD/mth to sustain
stay in a hotel everyday, travel
** start with some savings, four months is plenty
** aim for high margin, low touch
** aim for B2B
sell to companies who will in turn make money from your product, tools/resources
easier sell
** stupid ideas
 * consumer - customers, not "users"
 * physical - logistics, low margin
 * transactional - needs high volume
** good ideas
 * digital goods - wordpress themes
 * software - SaaS, paid mobile apps
 * eBooks
** validate your idea, make sure there is demand
originally beatrix was going to be a competitive analysis tool,
competitive intelligence for social media

small businesses don't have content to post on social media

started as finding content based on keywords for business to share

built in one month in Koh Samui
** have a story to launch with
makes for a more interesting new angle
provide a sneak preview before the public launch
** let people into the app in batches
had about 2k subscribers in the launch mailing
let in new users in batches to iteratively fix bugs, gather feedback
** always be marketing
blog posts, newletter blasts, funnel optimization
** always be creating
started writing a book as collected advice for startups
got 12k preorders in 1 month, see yongfook's blog post
now sells about 1+ book a day, passive income of $1k/mth
** the negatives
feeling disconnected, not hanging out with friends
