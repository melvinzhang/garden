** game balance is a fine line between too easy (boredom), too hard (frustration)
search for adrealin, where its exciting
an ebb and flow to the excitement to prevent fatigue
** system design simulation via spreadsheets (mathematical modelling)
levels and skill points, answers questions like at what level would a player max out a skill
** formula simulator -> change numbers and see effect
** graph formulas to visualize them, decide if reasonable, eg lockpicking area as a pie chart
** staff of 115
** system design vs world design
** feedback mostly annecdotal
** no sufficient time for detailed analysis for DLCs
** balancing wrt builds is done with play testing
