speaker: Norman Lee, SUTD

introduce machine learning in first year python course

The course is "The Digital World"
* raspberry pi
* thymio robot
* google firebase
* propose their own 1D and 2D project

Stucture of The Digital World
* programming concepts (six weeks)
* OOP (two weeks)
* intro to machine learning (one week)
* GUI (Kivy)

Flipped classroom
* students work on mini project during the class
* in groups

Lessons from  introducing machine learning
* inconsistent terminology in textbooks
  * follow the terms in scikit-learn
* chose the breast cancer dataset
  * 30 numerical features with binary categorical target
* prior to class
  * videos
  * pre-class activity
  * online quiz
* in-class problem set
* what we want the students to learn
  * the process
  * understanding the dataset
  * model for numerical prediction
    * linear regression
  * model for categorical prediction
    * k-nearest neighbours
    * easier to describe and explain
  * with python, students learn
    * jupyter notebook
    * matplotlib pyplot
    * scikit-learn
    * numpy

Lessons learnt
* code is short, concepts are deep
* numpy arrays are different from regular lists
* steps in machine learning
  * why we need to partition the data into three sets
* jupyter notebook
  * different from what they used before to program
* find a dataset for numerical prediction
* introduce tools earlier
