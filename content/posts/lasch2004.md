Considered Ward's algorithm, Fuzzy C-means and k-means algorithm for
colorectal adenocarcinoma.

In preprocessing the data, the following quality tests were applied
 * 50-250 integral intensity criterion in the wavelength range 950-1750cm^-1.
 * SNR test with 500 as threshold (signal: maximum of amide I band, noise:
* standard deviation in the spectral range 1800-1900cm^-1).

Spectra passing the tests were converted to first derivative using a
nine-smoothing point Savitzky-Golay algorithm. Derivative spectra were scaled
such that the sum deviation over 950-1750cm^-1 equals unity (vector
normalization).
