On my last trip to China in 2009, I found that WordPress was blocked. The platform has also become rather bloated and complicated to use. I eventually migrated to Posterous, which is based on email. You send an email to [post@posterous.com](mailto:post@posterous.com) and your blog post get created automatically from the content of the mail. This has the benefit of using a mature system to write and send messages (aka email) instead of a clunky web interface. Another benefit of using email, that I discovered recently in Shanghai, is that I can still create posts even though Posterous is blocked (ironically WordPress has been unblocked).
