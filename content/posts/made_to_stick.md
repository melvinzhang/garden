** What sticks
 * Kidney heist. Halloween candy. Movie popcorn
 * Sticky = understandable, memorable, and effective in changing thought or behavior
 * Simple Unexpected Concrete Credible Emotional Stories (SUCCESs)
 * Curse of Knowledge. It's hard to be a tapper.
 * Creativity starts with templates: Beat the Curse with the SUCCESs checklist
** Simple
*** Find the core
 * Commander's intent. Determine the single most important thing: "THE low-fare airline."
 * Inverted pyramid: Don't bury the lead.
 * The pain of decision paralysis. Beat decision paralysis through relentless prioritization: "It's the economy, stupid", "Names, names, names."
*** Share the core
 * Simple = core + compact. Proverbs: sounds bits that are profound.
 * Visual proverbs: The Palm Pilot wood block.
 * How to pack a lot of punch into a compact communication:
## using what's there: tap into existing schemas. The pomelo
## create a high concept pitch: "Die Hard on a bus"
## Use a generative analogy: Disney's "cast members"
** Unexpected
*** Get attention: Surprise
 * The successful flight safety announcement. Break a pattern! Break people's guessing machines (on a core issue).
 * The surprise brow: a pause to collect information.
 * Avoid gimmicky surprise - make it "postdictable"
 * "The Nordie who ...", "There will be no school next Thursday"
*** Hold attention: Interest
 * Create a mystery: What are Saturn's rings made of?
 * Screenplays as models of generating curiosity.
 * The Gap Theory of Curiosity: Highlight a knowledge gap.
 * Use the news-teaser approach: "Which local restaurant has slime in the ice machine?"
 * Priming the gap: How Roone Arledge made NCAA football interesting to nonfans.
 * Hold long-term interest: the "pocketable radio" and the "man on the moon"
** Concrete
*** Help people understand and remember
 * Write with the concreteness of a fable (Sour grapes)
 * Make abstraction concrete: The Nature Conservancy's landscapes as eco-celebrities.
 * Provide a concrete context: Asian teachers' approach to teaching math
 * Put people into the story: accounting class taught with a soap opera.
 * Use the Velcro theory of memory: The more hooks in your idea, the better.
 * Brown eyes, blue eyes: a simulation that "cured" racial prejudice.
*** Help people coordinate
 * Engineers vs manufacturers: Find common ground at a shared level of understanding.
 * Set common goals in tangible terms: Our plan will land on Runway 4-22.
 * Make it real: The Ferraris go to Disney World.
 * Why concreteness helps: white things versus white things in your refrigerator.
 * Create a turf where people can bring their knowledge to bear: The VC pitch and the maroon portfolio.
 * Talk about people, not data: Hamburger Helper's in-home visits and "Saddleback Sam"
** Credible
*** Help people believe
 * The Nobel-winning ulcer insight no one believed. Flesh-eating bananas.
*** External credibility
Authority and antiauthority. Pam Laffin, smoker.
*** Internal credibility
 * Use convincing details. Jurors and the Darth Vader Toothbrush. The dancing seventy-three year old.
 * Make statistics accessible. Nuclear warheads as BBs. The Human Scale principle. Stephen Covey's analogy of a workplace to a soccer team
 * Find an example that passes that Sinatra Test. "If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere."
 * Transporting Bollywood movies: "We handled Harry Potter and your brother's board exams."
 * A business-friendly environmentalist and the textile factory that actually purified the water that fed it - and yielded fabric that was edible
 * Use testable credentials. "Try before you buy." Where's the beef? Snapple supports the KKK?!
 * Coaches: It's easier to tear down than to build up: Filling the Emotional Tank.
 * NBA rookie orientation: "These women all have AIDS."
** Emotional
*** Make people care
 * The Mother Teresa principle: If I look at the one, I will act. People donate more to Rokia than to a huge swath of Africa.
 * The Truth anti-smoking campaign: What made kids care was not health concerns but anticorporate rebelling
*** Use the power of association
 * The need to fight semantic stretch: the diluted meaning of "relativity" and why "unique" isn't unique anymore.
 * Transforming "sportsmanship" into "honoring the game"
*** Appeal to self-interest (and not just base self-interest)
 * Mail-order ads - "They laughed when I sat down at the piano..."
 * WIIFY. Cable television in Tempe: Visualizing what it could do for you.
 * Avoid Maslow's basement: our false assumption that other people are baser than we are.
 * Floyd Lee and his Iraq mess tent: "I'm in charge of morale."
*** Appeal to identity
 * The firemen who rejected the popcorn popper. Understand how people make decisions based on identity.
 * Who am I? What kind of situation is this? And what do people like me do in this kind of situation?
 * Don't mess with Texas: Texan's don't litter.
 * Don't forget the Curse of Knowledge - don't assume, like the defenders of the duo piano, that others care at the same level that you do.
** Story
*** Get people to act
*** Stories as simulation (tell people how to act)
 * The day the heart monitor lied: how the nurse acted.
 * Shop talk at Xerox: how the repairman acted.
 * Visualizing "how I got here": simulating problem to solve them.
 * Use stories as flight simulators.
*** Stories as inspiration (give people energy to act)
 * Jard, the 425-pound fast food dieter.
 * How to spot inspiring stories. Look for three key plots: Challenge (to overcome obstacles), Connection (to get along or reconnect), Creativity (to inspire a new way of thinking).
 * Tell a springboard story: a story that helps people see how an existing problem might change.
 * Stephen Denning at the World Bank: a health worker in Zambia.
 * You can extract a moral from a story, but you can't extract a story from a moral.
 * Why speakers got mad when people boiled down their presentations to stories.
** What sticks
*** Use what sticks
 * Nice guys finish last. Elementary, my dear Watson. It's the economy, stupid. The power of spotting.
 * Why good speaking skills aren't necessarily good sticking skills: Standford students and the speech exercise.
 * A final warning about the Curse of Knowledge.
 * Remember how SUCCESs helps people to:
 ** Pay attention - Unexpected
 ** Understand and remember - Concrete
 ** Believe and agree - Credible
 ** Care - Emotional
 ** Act - Stories
 * Simple helps at many stages. Most importantly, it tells you what to say
 * JFK vs Floyd Lee: How normal people, in normal situations, can make a profound different with their sticky ideas.
