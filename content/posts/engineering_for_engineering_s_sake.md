event: Carousell tech talk

Engineering is fun
* at work vs at home

Being a magpie
* choosing new and shiny tools
* asp.net web forms -> asp.net mvc
* svn -> git

Peer to peer marketplace needed a feed
* company: vinted
* wanted: picks, followed, suggestions
* chose redis, but ran into a lot of problems
* took 1.5 years to clear the technical debt

Etsy faced the same problem in 2010
* chose to use memcached
* already in their current stack

boring vs exciting
* memcached was more mature in 2013
* redis was the new and shiny tool

part of stack vs new tech
* knowledge in the company
* growing the stack -> more choices to consider
* operational overhead

Engineering is fun, but shipping is more fun

take home principles
* use boring stuff
* optimize company wide
  * solve problems with what you already have

tackling analytics at vinted
* looked at hadoop
* stuck to mysql for a long while
* eventually switch to hadoop with a lot of effort
