Title: Graph theory in recombinatorial population genomics

IBM's genographic project. Using the Y chr and mtDNA does not provide a complete
view. Can only trace along parental or maternal lines but not a combination of
the two.

Using autosomes leads to Ancestral recombination graph, need to deal with
recombination.

Q: Given tree, can we reconstruct ARG?
A: Use a random graph framework and the Wright-Fisscher model

G_PG (pedegree graph) could have infinite LCA because of ancestor without
ancestry problem

G_PGE models genetic exchange, LCAA is LCA with ancestry, equivalent to GMRCA
in population genetics.
