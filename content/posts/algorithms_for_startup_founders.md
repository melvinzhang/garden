How to hire the best engineer?
* aka the secretary problem
* hire the best after X interviews
* run simulations, X is 37%

Which problem should you deal with first?
* aka single-machine scheduling problem
* each task as weight, duration, due date
* compares the following:
  * choose a task at random
  * faster tasks first
  * important tasks first
  * due task first

Pivot or Persevere?
* aka multi-armed bandit
* stick to one arm
* randomly choose a arm
* e-greedy, e = 10%
  * not as good as stick to one when variance is low
