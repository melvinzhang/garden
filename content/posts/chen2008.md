** Motif discovery
# cluster coregulated genes
 ** gene annotation
 ** gene expression
 ** ChIP-ChIP
 ** phylogenetic footprinting
# find DNA patterns that are enriched

** Finding motifs
 * How to select cutoff?
 * combinatorial, word statistics
 * probabilistic, local MSA

** Gibbs sampler
 * special case of Metropolis-Hasting sampling
 * related work: KIMONO, REDUCE, GMEP, MDScan, Motif Repressor, EBMF

** Sequence weighting
 * highly expressed genes should be given more weight in PWM
 * present cutoff not needed since they will have small weight
