** Snow leopard trust
At least one snow leopard is killed everyday
* mining, poaching, retribution killing

Took 9 years to collar 23 snow leopards

300+ camera traps
* pictures are manually classified
* 5% contain snow leopards
  * many others were triggered by goats

Use RESNET-50 to identify images with snow leopards
* currently working on identifying individuals

** Land use classification of aerial imagery

** CNN + transfer learning
using the last few layers as featurizer
use the features with a classical classifier

** Drones for utility line inspection
YOLOv2 achieves 90fps for object detection
challenges for small object detection

** Generating synthetic images to solve the minority class problem
convert drone footage to CAD models, generate synthetic images for the minority class

** Lowe's for gathering customer style preference
customers can indicate if they like/dislike a particular design

** Trends
GANS
* image generation
GANS + RL
* sequence generation
New NN representation
* capsules?
common representation of DNN
* onnx format
AI at the edge
* reducing the size of DNN to run on embedded platforms

** Demo
