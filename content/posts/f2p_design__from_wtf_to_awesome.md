event: IGDA meetup
** background
originally a trained musician
spent the last 6 years on F2P games
** F2P has greater reach
LoL has over 67 million user every month
huge AAA can hope for 5-10 million units
** does not discriminate between those who can afford and those who can't
the great democratisation of gaming, F2P penetration in the developing world is huge
F2P allows players who are time poor and cash rich to be competitive
** games as a service
traditional games are "fire and forget"
F2P developers are responsible for the game on a day to day basis
** paid players get an unfair advantage
most games manage to monetize less than 10% of the users
Candy Crush Saga can be completed without paying a single cent
** F2P is great for
an online game where users can invest lots of time
** F2P success formula
ARPDAU x Avg retention > cost to acquire a user + infrastructure cost per user
ARPDAU = average revenue per daily active user
** Myth of "build it and they will come"
why will players give up games they've investe months to come play yours?
what is your unique selling point? can you explain it in one simple sentence?
** Epic tutorials that are too long
** Complex UX drives the player away
** Make them want more
the design should encourage the habit
session length management, an energy system
daily challenges
tease the task list/achivements
** Make spending a positive experience
getting a legendary card in Hearthstone
** Goodwill doesn't pay the bills
scalable item systems
the LoL fallacy: we will sell vanity items
proposition > price
** social to reduce cost of user acquisition
** don't fear the data
know what are the key metrics
you can measure "fun"
check the data before building features
** F2P games are not the best platform to showcase the story
causes players to drop out
allow users to project their own stories on to the game universe
some story to tie into live ops such as double xp events
** who are you making your game for?
