Title: Extensive genomic duplication during early chordate evolution

The hypothesized genome duplications event were postulated to have occurred
during chordate evolution, we focused on gene duplications younger than the
divergence between humans and two invertebrates (D. melanogaster and C.
elegans).

96 paralogons with $sm \ge 6$ covered 44% of the genome with an average
redundancy of magnitude 1.3, where as 504 paralogons with $sm \ge 3$ covered
79% of the genome with a redundancy of magnitude 2.1.

Used molecular clock to estimate the ages of gene duplications that occurred
during chordate evolution. 758 gene families have two to ten human members and
fly and nematode orthologs.
