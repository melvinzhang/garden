A hidden level of information processing behind the observed reality.

Heisenberg: represent a physical quantity with an infinitly large matrix, it is
possible to derive properties of atoms like their quantized energy levels.

The Copenhagen Interpretation (1927)
* it is the act of measurement itself which creates the measured value

Bell's Theorem (1964)
* Einstein was wrong, hidden variables cannot remove action at a distance

Experimental verification of Bell's non locality in 2015

Explaining Bell-type quantum correlations with a game by P. K. Arvind
* team of 2 vs the referee
* 3x3 matrix of zeros and ones
* a magic matrix
  * each column has an even number of ones
  * each row has an odd number of ones
* not possible to construct such a matrix as the number of ones is either odd or even
* in a trial, ask for one row and one column
  * will get at least 1/9 of the trials wrong
* with entangled particles, it is possible to be right all the time

Applications of entanglement
* Bell-type correlation to enable absolutely secure communication
* quantum teleportation
* quantum computing

Difference interpretations
* Bohr
* Everett
* Bohm
