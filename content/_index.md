# Welcome to my digital garden

Learning about the [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)
has reignited my interest in developing ideas from notes. This site is one among many
[Digital Gardens](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners#digital-garden-directory).

Most of my notes are stored in a single text file except for blog posts and
social media posts. The goal is to merge all the content into one file and
extract parts of it to be published here.

## Current progress
* [Learning Day sharings]({{< relref "learning_day" >}})
* [Social media posts]({{< relref "social_media_posts" >}})
* [Blog posts (2008â€“2011)]({{< relref "blog_posts" >}})

## Inspiration
* [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/)
* [Jethro's Braindump](https://braindump.jethro.dev/)
* [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

## Behind the scenes
* [source](https://github.com/melvinzhang/garden) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Cortex theme](https://github.com/jethrokuan/cortex) for the site template
* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to generate the site
