# Welcome to my digital garden

The goal is to consolidate all of my writings on this site. At the moment, I
have several sites, one for [Learning Day](https://www.facebook.com/groups/praxiumlearning)
and another for [blog posts](https://blog.melvinzhang.net/).

Learning about the [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)
has reignited my interest in developing ideas from notes. This site is one among many
[Digital Gardens](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners#digital-garden-directory).

My personal notes is stored in a single text file. The idea is to merge all the
content into that file and then extract parts of it to be published here.

## Current progress
* [My learning day sharings](/posts/ld) in one giant note (to be split up later)

## Inspiration
* [Andy's working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/)
* [Jethro's Braindump](https://braindump.jethro.dev/)
* [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)
