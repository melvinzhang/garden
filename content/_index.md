# Welcome!

Since 2006, I've kept notes on various subjects of interest. In 2021, I
learnt about the [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) and [Digital
Gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) and it changed the way I view my notes.

They are no longer just an archive of thoughts but rather a way to develop new
ideas.  I'm putting some of my notes here[^bts] in the spirit of [Learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/).
